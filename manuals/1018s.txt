and maintenance of any Fisher
product remains with the purchaser
and end-user.
WARNING
If you move or work on an actuator
fitted to the valve with loading
pressure applied, keep your hands and
tools away from the stem travel path to
avoid personal injury. Be especially
careful when removing the stem
connector to release all loading on the
actuator stem whether it be from air
pressure on the diaphragm or
compression in the actuator springs.
Likewise take similar care when
adjusting or removing any optional
travel stop. Refer to the relevant
actuator Maintenance Instructions.
If hoisting the valve take care to
prevent people from being injured in
case the hoist or rigging slips. Be sure
to use adequately sized hoists and
chains or slings to handle the valve.
1. Before installing the valve, inspect it to be certain
that the valve body cavity is free of all foreign
material. Clean out all pipelines to remove scale,
welding slag and other foreign material.
2. The control valve assembly may be installed in
any orientation unless limited by seismic criteria.
However, the normal method is with the actuator
vertical above the valve. Flow through the valve
must be in the direction indicated by the arrow cast
on the valve.
3. Use accepted piping practices when installing the
valve in the pipeline. Use a suitable gasket between
the valve and the pipeline flanges.
4. With a leak-off bonnet construction, remove the
pipe plug to hook up the leak-off piping.
5. If continuous operation is required during
inspection or maintenance, install isolating valves
either side of the control valve with a bypass valve to
control the flow while the control valve is being
worked on.
6. If the actuator and valve are shipped separately,
refer to the appropriate instruction manual for the
actuator mounting procedure.
WARNING
Personal injury could result from
packing leakage. Valve packing is
tightened before shipment; however
the packing might require some
readjustment to meet specific service
conditions.
Maintenance
WARNING
Avoid personal injury or property
damage from sudden release of
process pressure or bursting of parts.
Before performing any maintenance
operations:
 Always wear protective gloves,
clothing, and eyewear when
performing any maintenance
operations to avoid personal injury.
 Disconnect any operating lines
providing air pressure, electric power
or a control signal to the actuator. Be
sure the actuator cannot suddenly
open or close the valve.
 Use bypass valves or completely
shut off the process to isolate the
valve from the process pressure.
Relieve the process pressure from
both sides of the valve.
 Depending on the actuator
construction, it will be necessary to
manage the pneumatic actuator
loading pressure and any actuator
spring pre-compression. It is essential
to refer to the relevant actuator
instruction manual to ensure safe
removal of the actuator from the valve.
 Use lock-out procedures to be
sure that the above measures stay in
effect while you work on the
equipment.
 The valve packing box may
contain process fluids that are
pressurized, even when the valve has
been removed from the pipeline.
Process fluids may spray out under
pressure when removing the packing

hardware or packing rings, or when
loosening the packing box pipe plug.
 Check with your process or safety
engineer for any additional measures
that must be taken to protect against
process media.
Note
Whenever a gasket seal is disturbed
by removing or shifting gasketed
parts, install a new gasket during
reassembly. This ensures a good
gasket seal because the used gasket
may not seal properly.
Packing Lubrication
If a lubricator, or lubricator and isolating valve (figure
2) is provided for PTFE/composition or other
packings that require lubrication, it is installed in a
tapped bonnet. Use a silicon based lubricant.
Packing used in oxygen service or in processes with
temperatures over 260C (500F) should not be
lubricated. To operate the lubricator, turn the screw
clockwise to force the lubricant into the packing box.
The lubricator/isolating valve operates the same way
except the isolating valve must first be opened and
then closed after the lubrication has been
completed.
Packing Maintenance
Key numbers refer to figures 3, 4, 5, and 8.
For spring-loaded single PTFE V-ring packing, the
packing spring (key 8.10) maintains a sealing force
on the packing. If leakage is noted around the top
bushing (key 8.2) check to be sure that the packing
flange (key 8.1) is touching the bonnet (key 2). If the
packing flange is not touching the bonnet, tighten the
packing flange cap screws (key 8.3) until the packing
flange is against the bonnet. If leakage cannot be
stopped in this manner proceed to the replacing
packing procedure.
If there is unacceptable packing leakage with other
than spring-loaded packing, first try to limit the
leakage and establish a stem seal by tightening the
packing flange cap screws (key 8.3) to at least the
minimum recommended torque in table 3. However
do not exceed the maximum recommended torque in
table 3 or excessive friction may result. If the
packing (key 8) is relatively new and tight on the
stem and tightening the packing flange nuts does not
stop the leakage, it is possible that the stem is worn
or nicked so that a seal cannot be made. The
surface finish of a valve stem is critical for making a
good packing seal. If the leakage comes from the
outside diameter of the packing it is possible that the
leakage comes from nicks or scratches around the
packing box wall. While replacing the packing, as in
the numbered steps below, inspect the valve stem
and packing box wall for nicks and scratches.
Note
If the valve has ENVIRO-SEAL
packing installed, refer to the
instruction manual entitled
ENVIRO-SEAL Packing System for
Sliding Stem Valves, Form 5306, for
packing instructions. Figure 5 in this
manual shows typical ENVIRO-SEAL
packing systems.
Replacing Packing
These instructions refer primarily to valves fitted with
plain bonnets. When replacing packing in an
extension or bellows bonnet you should refer to the
relevant section under Bonnet Constructions later in
this manual for details on disassembly and
reassembly of valves with extension and bellows
bonnets.
1. Isolate the control valve from the line pressure,
release pressure from both sides of the valve body
and drain the process media from both sides of the
valve. If using a power actuator, also shut off all
pressure lines to the power actuator and release all
1018S Valve
Instruction Manual

pressure from the actuator. Use lock-out procedures
to be sure that the above measures stay in effect
while you work on the equipment.
2. Disconnect the operating lines from the actuator
and any leak-off piping from the bonnet. Disconnect
the stem connector and then remove the actuator
from the valve by unscrewing the yoke lock nut (key
11, figure 8). Refer to the appropriate actuator
instruction manual for details.
WARNING
To avoid personal injury or property
damage by uncontrolled movement of
the bonnet, loosen the bonnet bolting
by following the instructions in the
next step. Do not remove a stuck
bonnet by pulling on it with equipment
that can stretch or store energy in any
other manner. The sudden release of
stored energy can cause uncontrolled
movement of the bonnet.
Note
The following step also provides
additional assurance that the valve
body fluid pressure has been relieved.
3. Hex nuts (key 9.3) attach the bonnet (key 2) to
the valve body (key 1). Loosen these nuts
approximately 3mm (1/8 inch). Then loosen the
body-to-bonnet gasketed joint by either rocking the
bonnet or prying between the body and bonnet.
Work the prying tool around the bonnet until the
bonnet loosens.
CAUTION
Avoid damaging the seating surface
caused by the valve plug and stem
assembly dropping from the bonnet
after being lifted part way out. When
lifting the bonnet temporarily install a
valve stem locknut on the valve stem.
This locknut will prevent the valve
plug and stem assembly from
dropping out of the bonnet.
4. If no fluid leaks from the joint, remove the bonnet
nuts (key 9.3) completely and carefully lift off the
bonnet complete with plug and stem assembly.
5. Loosen the packing flange cap screws (key 8.3)
so that the packing is not tight on the valve stem.
Remove any travel indicator parts and stem locknuts
from the valve stem threads.
6. Set the bonnet and stem assembly on a
protective surface to prevent damage to the bonnet
gasket surface and plug seat. Separate the plug and
stem assembly from the bonnet.
7. Remove the bonnet gasket (key 9.1) and cover
the opening of the valve to protect the gasket
surface and prevent foreign matter from getting into
the valve cavity.
8. Remove the packing flange cap screws, packing
flange and top bushing (keys 8.3, 8.1 and 8.2).
Carefully push out all the remaining packing box
parts from the bonnet using a rounded rod or other
tool which will not scratch the packing box wall or
bottom guide bushing. Clean the packing box and
the metal packing box parts.
9. Inspect the valve stem threads and packing box
surfaces for any sharp edges that might cut the
packing. Scratches or burrs could cause packing box
leakage or damage the new packing. If the surface
condition cannot be improved by light sanding,
replace the damaged parts.
10. Remove the covering protecting the valve cavity
and install a new bonnet gasket (key 9.1) making
sure that the gasket seating surfaces are clean and
smooth.
Note
The bolting procedures in step 11
include, but are not limited to,
ensuring that the bolting threads are
clean and that the nuts are evenly
tightened on the studs in a crisscross
pattern. Tightening one nut may
loosen an adjacent nut. Repeat the
crisscross tightening pattern several
times until each nut is tight and the
body-to-bonnet seal is made. When
the operating temperature has been
reached perform the torque procedure
again.
11. Lubricate the bonnet studs (key 9.2), nuts (key
9.3) and the surface between the nuts and bonnet
with a suitable lubricant. Carefully slide the valve
plug into the bonnet, slide the bonnet onto the bolts
(key 9.2) and secure with the stud bolt nuts (key
9.3). Using accepted bolting procedures, tighten the
body-to-bonnet joint to withstand test pressures and
application service conditions. Use the bolt torques
in table 4 as guidelines unless accepted bolting
procedures dictate otherwise.

12. Install the new packing and the metal packing
box parts according to the appropriate arrangement
in figure 3, 4, or 5. Place a smooth-edged pipe over
the valve stem and gently tap each soft packing part
into the packing box.
13. Slide the top bushing and packing flange (keys
8.2 and 8.1) into position. Lubricate the packing
flange cap screws (key 8.3), including the underside
of the head of the cap screws. Fit the cap screws.
Note
The torque values discussed in step
14 and shown in table 3 are
recommended guidelines only and are
presented as a starting point for this
procedure. Tightening the packing
flange nuts to a torque value that
exceeds the table guidelines, in order
to obtain a seal, may indicate other
problems.
14. For spring-loaded PTFE V-ring packing tighten
the packing flange cap screws until the flange (key
8.1) contacts the bonnet.
15. For graphite packing tighten the packing flange
cap screws to the maximum recommended torque
shown in table 3. Then loosen the packing flange
cap screws and retighten to the minimum
recommended torque shown in table 3.
For ENVIRO-SEAL packing refer to the instruction
manual entitled ENVIRO-SEAL Packing System for
Sliding Stem Valves, Form 5306, for packing
instructions.
For other packing types tighten the packing flange
cap screws alternately in small equal increments
until one of the cap screws reaches the minimum
recommended torque shown in table 3. Then, tighten
the remaining flange cap screw until the packing
flange is level and at a 90 degree angle to the valve
stem.
16. Mount the actuator on the bonnet (key 2) and
reconnect the actuator and valve plug stem
according to the procedure in the appropriate
actuator instruction manual. Check for leakage
around the top bushing when the control valve
assembly is first put in to service. Retighten the
packing flange cap screws as required.

Trim Maintenance
Key numbers in this section refer to figure 8.
Disassembly
1. Remove the actuator and bonnet as described in
steps 1 to 7 of the section Replacing the Packing.
CAUTION
Use care to avoid damaging the gasket
sealing surfaces.
The surface finish of the valve stem
(key 6, 7 or 7.1) is critical for making a
good packing seal. The seating
surfaces of the seat ring (key 4) and
the valve plug (key 6) are critical for
tight shutoff and should therefore also
be treated with care and properly
protected.
2. Packing parts can be removed from the bonnet if
desired. Replace these parts as described in the
section on Packing Maintenance.
3. Use a seat ring tool made according to the
dimensions in figure 6 to remove the seat ring (key
4) as follows:
a. Insert the tool into the valve body. Be certain
the tool lugs are engaged in the corresponding
recesses in the seat ring.
b. Use a torque gun or driver having torque
capabilities equal to or greater than those shown
in table 5. Connect the gun to a socket that
snugly fits the hex head on the seat ring tool.
c. Insert the socket onto the hex head of the seat
ring tool.

CAUTION
Be careful to hold the torque gun and
attached socket at right angles to the
seat ring when applying torque. Tilting
the gun and socket while applying
torque may cause the lugs on the seat
ring tool to suddenly disengage from
the recesses in the seat ring thus
causing possible damage to the seat
ring.
4. Remove the seat ring (key 4) from the valve
body.
5. Inspect parts for wear or damage that would
prevent proper operation of the valve body.
6. Replace trim parts as necessary.
Assembly
1. Before installing the new seat ring, thoroughly
clean the threads in the valve body port. Apply
suitable lubricant to the threads and to the 60
surface of the new seat ring (see key 4, figures 8
and 9). Screw the seat ring into the valve body.
Using the seat ring tool, a lathe or boring mill, tighten
the seat ring to the torque value in table 5. Remove
all excess lubricant after tightening.
2. Remove any protective tape or covering from the
valve plug and stem assembly and carefully install it
into the valve body.
3. Clean the bonnet gasket seating surfaces and
install a new bonnet gasket.

Figure 6. Removal and Installation Tool
Note
If the packing is to be reused and was
not removed from the bonnet, perform
the following step carefully to avoid
damaging the packing with the stem
threads.
4. Mount the bonnet on the valve body and
complete assembly according to steps 9 to 13 of the
section Replacing the Packing, omitting steps 12
and 13 if new packing is not being installed.
Lapping Metal Seats
CAUTION
To avoid damaging the bellows
assembly in a bellows bonnet
construction, do not attempt to lap the
metal seating surfaces on valves of
this type. The design of the bonnet
assembly prevents rotation of the stem
and any forced lapping rotation will
damage the bellows.
With metal-seat constructions, seating surfaces of
the valve plug and seat ring can be lapped for
improved shutoff. Deep nicks and scratches should
be machined out rather than ground out. Use a good
quality lapping compound of a mixture of 280 to
600-grit. Apply the compound to the bottom of the
valve plug.
Assemble the valve to the extent that the seat ring
(key 4) and plug and stem assembly (key 6) are
fitted and the bonnet (key 2), complete with guide
bushing (key 8.2), is bolted to the valve body. A
simple handle can be made from a piece of strap
iron locked to the valve stem with nuts. After lapping,
remove the bonnet and clean the seat surfaces.
Completely assemble as described in the assembly
portion of the Trim Maintenance procedure and test
the valve for shutoff. Repeat the lapping procedure if
leakage is still excessive.
Noise Attenuation Trim
Key numbers refer to figure 10.
The 1018S multi-hole noise trim provides
aerodynamic noise control that is effective for vapor,
gas and steam flow applications and can be used
with the standard metal-to-metal seat, the soft
seated Teflon insert and the hard faced seats.
Disassembly
1. Remove the actuator and bonnet as described in
steps 1 to 4 of the section Replacing the Packing.
2. When lifting the bonnet and stem assembly off
the valve body, the cage retaining ring, and possibly
the multi-hole cage itself, will also lift with the rest of
the assembly.

3. Loosen the packing flange cap screws (key 8.4)
so that the packing is not tight on the valve stem.
Remove any travel indicator parts and stem locknuts
from the valve stem threads
CAUTION
Use care to avoid damaging the gasket
sealing surfaces.
The surface finish of the valve stem
(key 6, 7 or 7.1) is critical for making a
good packing seal. The seating
surfaces of the seat ring (key 4) and
the valve plug (key 6) are critical for
tight shutoff and should therefore also
be treated with care and properly
protected.
4. Set the bonnet and stem assembly on a
protective surface to prevent damage to the bonnet
gasket surface and plug seat. Separate the plug and
stem assembly from the bonnet. Separate the cage
retaining ring and the multi-hole cage.
5. Remove the seat ring in the normal way as
described above.
Assembly
Follow the assembly instructions above in the Trim
Maintenance section but with the following
exceptions.
1. Having screwed in the seat ring (key 4), slot the
multi-hole cage (key 5.1) into the groove on the top
of the seat ring. Ensure that the end with the vertical
slots is uppermost.
2. Place the plug and stem assembly (key 6) inside
the cage on the seat ring and pass the cage
retaining ring (key 5.2) with the tapered side down
over the stem and place on the top of the cage.
3. Carefully slide the bonnet (key 2) over the stem
and locate its base in the center of the cage
retaining ring (key 5.2) and, at the same time, over
the bonnet studs (key 9.2).
4. The process of tightening the bonnet nuts (key
9.3) will pull the cage retaining ring into the top of the
multi-hole cage splaying out the top circumference of
the cage to provide a firm interference fit (see
figure 10).
Bonnet Constructions
Three bonnet constructions are available. The
standard plain bonnet (fig 8) incorporates a welded
plug and stem assembly. Note, these parts are only
available as an assembly. For extreme temperatures
or difficult to handle fluids either an extension bonnet
(fig 11) or a bellows bonnet (fig 12) may be fitted.
These incorporate a bonnet extension (key 12.1)
which fits between the bonnet and the valve body.
Extension Bonnets
Refer to figure 11.
For the extension bonnet arrangement the plug and
stem are supplied as separate parts. When replacing
the plug and stem follow the instructions below.
Disassembly
1. Follow steps 1 - 7 shown in the section Replacing
Packing.
2. Carefully slide the plug and stem assembly out of
the bonnet taking care not to damage the packing
with the stem thread.
Assembly
1. Screw the new valve stem (key 7) firmly into the
new plug (key 6). Refer to figure 7 for the correct
torque.
2. Using the dimensions given in figure 7 select the
proper drill size and drill through the plug and stem
using the pilot hole provided in the plug.
3. Remove any chips or burrs and drive in a new pin
(key 9.4). Ensure that the pin extends evenly either
side of the plug. The extended pin prevents rotation
of the plug and stem once the valve is assembled.
CAUTION
To avoid weakening the stem that may
cause failure in service, never reuse an
old stem with a new valve plug. Using
an old stem with a new plug requires
drilling a new pin hole in the stem
which will weaken it. However a used
valve plug may be used with a new
stem.
4. Carefully insert the plug and stem assembly in to
the bonnet taking care not to damage the valve
packing.

5. Slide the plug and stem assembly to the full up
position such that the extending ends of the
plug/stem pin are located in the vertical groove in the
bore of the guide bush.
6. Remove the covering protecting the valve cavity
and install a new bonnet gasket (key 9.1) making
sure that the gasket seating surfaces are clean and
smooth.
7. Lift the whole assembly, taking care that the plug
and stem assembly does not slide out, on to the
valve body and over the bonnet studs (key 9.2).
8. Lubricate the bonnet studs (key 9.2), nuts (key
9.3) and the surface between the nuts and bonnet
with a suitable lubricant. Tighten the nuts (key 9.3) in
a crisscross pattern until the metallic stop at the
bottom side of the bonnet flange contacts the body
surface. This will guarantee that the body to bonnet
joint will withstand test pressures and application
service conditions (see table 4 for details).
Bellows Bonnet
Refer to figure 12.
Disassembly
1. Follow steps 1 - 2 shown in the section Replacing
the Packing.
WARNING
To avoid personal injury or property
damage by uncontrolled movement of
the bonnet, loosen the bonnet bolting
by following the instructions in the
next step. Do not remove a stuck
bonnet by pulling on it with equipment
that can stretch or store energy in any
other manner. The sudden release of
stored energy can cause uncontrolled
movement of the bonnet.
Note
The following step also provides
additional assurance that the valve
body fluid pressure has been relieved.
2. Cap screws (key 9.7) and hex nuts (key 9.8)
attach the valve bonnet (key 2) to the bonnet
extension (key 12.1). Loosen these nuts
approximately 3mm (1/8 inch). Then loosen the
bonnet-to-extension joint by either rocking the
bonnet or prying between the bonnet and bonnet
extension. Work the prying tool around the bonnet
until the bonnet loosens. If no fluid leaks from the
joint, remove the nuts and cap screws completely
and carefully lift the bonnet off the valve stem.
3. Hex nuts (key 9.3) attach the bonnet extension
(key 12.1) to the valve body (key 1). Remove these
nuts and loosen the extension-to-body gasketed joint
by either rocking the bonnet or prying the extension
of the body.
4. Lift the extension (key 12.1) , complete with the
bellows, stem and plug assembly, clear of the body
and place on a protective surface.
5. Extend the plug (key 6) and stem (key 7.1) from
the base of the bonnet extension to expose the
plug/stem pin (key 9.4). Drive out the plug/stem pin
and unscrew the plug from the stem.
6. Slide the stem and bellows assembly (key 7.3)
through the top of the bonnet extension (key 12.1)
removing the two bonnet gaskets.
7. Inspect all parts for signs of wear and damage
and replace as necessary.

Assembly
1. Inspect all gasket seating surfaces on the bonnet
(key 2), bonnet extension (key 12.1) and valve body
(key 1) to ensure they are clean and smooth.
2. Taking the stem and bellows assembly screw on
the plug (key 6) to give a firm fit. Take care not to
rotate the bellows or otherwise damage the bellows
in the process.
3. Using the pilot hole in the plug, drill through the
plug and stem using the appropriate drill shown in
figure 7. Then unscrew the plug from the stem.
4. Place a bellows gasket (key 9.6) on the top of
bonnet extension (key 12.1) and slide the stem and
bellows assembly from the top through the bonnet
extension.
5. Place the second bellows gasket (key 9.6) on the
top surface of the bellows assembly and then
carefully place the bonnet over the stem taking care
not to damage the packing if fitted.
6. Bolt the bonnet to the bonnet extension using the
cap screws (key 9.7) and hex nuts (key 9.8) but only
partially tighten the nuts. Refer to table 4.
7. Re-screw the plug (key 6) on to the base of the
stem (key 7.1) until the holes in the plug and stem,
made in step 3 above, align. Extend the stem as far
as possible from the base of the bellows and drive in
a new pin (key 9.4) ensuring that the pin extends
equally either side of the plug.
8. Slacken the cap screws (key 9.7) and hex nuts
(key 9.8) of the bonnet and then rotate the complete
stem, plug and bellows assembly until the ends of
the pin extending from the plug align with the vertical
grooves in the bore of the guide bush (key 12.2).
This construction prevents the plug and stem
assembly rotating when the valve is in service.
9. Retighten the cap screws (key 9.7) and hex nuts
(key 9.8) to the correct torque shown in table 4.
10. Place a new bonnet extension-to-body gasket
(key 9.1) on the gasket surface of the valve body
(key 1) and carefully lift the complete bonnet
assembly on to the bonnet studs in the body.
11. Tighten the hex nuts (key 9.3) as shown in
table 3.
Parts Ordering
Each valve is assigned a serial number which can
be found on the valve or on the nameplate (key 18,
not shown). The nameplate will normally be fitted to
the actuator but if the valve is supplied without an
actuator the nameplate will be wired to the valve.
Refer to this serial number when contacting your
Fisher sales office for technical assistance. When
ordering replacement parts refer to this serial
number and give the part description and part
number from the following parts list.
Use only genuine Fisher replacement parts.
Components that are not supplied by Fisher should
not, under any circumstances, be used in any Fisher
valve, because they will void your warranty, might
adversely affect the performance of the valve, and
might jeopardize worker and workplace safety.
