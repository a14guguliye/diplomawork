Product Descriptions
The 67D Series Direct-Operated Regulators are typically
used to provide constantly controlled, reduced pressures.
They are suitable for most air or gas applications.
• The Types 67D and 67DS are the standard
instrument supply regulators without a filter or
internal relief.
• The Types 67DF and 67DFS are equipped with a
filter for removing particles from the supply gas.
• The Types 67DR and 67DSR have an internal relief
valve with a soft seat for reliable shutoff with no
discernible leakage.
• The Types 67DFR and 67DFSR have a filter and
internal relief valve with a soft seat for reliable
shutoff with no discernible leakage.
Principle of Operation
Downstream pressure is registered internally on the
lower side of the diaphragm. When the downstream
pressure is at or above the set pressure, the valve plug
is held against the orifice and there is no flow through
the regulator. When demand increases, downstream
pressure drops slightly allowing the spring to extend,
moving the stem down and the valve plug away from
the orifice. This allows flow through the regulator.
Internal Relief (Types 67DR, 67DSR,
67DFR and 67DFSR)
If for some reason, outside of normal operating
conditions, the downstream pressure exceeds the
setpoint of the regulator, the force created by the
downstream pressure will lift the diaphragm until
the diaphragm is lifted off the relief seat. This allows
flow through the token relief. The relief valve on
the Type 67DR, 67DSR, 67DFR or 67DFSR is an
elastomer plug that prevents leakage of air from the
downstream to atmosphere during normal operation,
thereby conserving plant air.
Smart Bleed™ Airset
Recommended for fail-safe actuators, no bleed
applications, and dead-end service.
In some cases, it is desired to exhaust downstream
pressure if inlet pressure is lost or drops below the
setpoint of the regulator. For example, if the regulator
is installed on equipment that at times has no flow
demand but is expected to backflow on loss of inlet
pressure. The Types 67DFR and 67DFSR can be
ordered with the Smart Bleed option which includes
an integrated soft seat check valve for this application.
During operation, if inlet pressure is lost, or decreases
below the setpoint of the regulator, the downstream
pressure will back flow upstream through the regulator
and check valve.

This option eliminates the need for a fixed bleed
downstream of the regulator, thereby conserving plant
air. In addition, the soft seat feature of the check valve
eliminates leakage while the airset is in the lock-up
position preventing pressure build-up that could trip
safety loop functions on valves.
Installation
Note
If the regulator is shipped mounted on
another unit, install that unit according
to the appropriate Instruction Manual.
Personal injury, property damage,
equipment damage or leakage
due to escaping gas or bursting of
pressure-containing parts may result
if this regulator is overpressured or
is installed where service conditions
could exceed the limits given in the
Specifications section, or where
conditions exceed any ratings of the
adjacent piping or piping connections.
To avoid such injury or damage, provide
pressure-relieving or pressure-limiting
devices (as required by the appropriate
code, regulation or standard) to prevent
service conditions from exceeding
those limits.
The internal relief valve of the
Type 67DR, 67DSR, 67DFR or 67DFSR
does not provide full overpressure
protection. The internal relief valve is
designed for minor seat leakage only.
If maximum inlet pressure to the
regulator exceeds maximum pressure
ratings of the downstream equipment
or exceeds maximum allowable outlet
pressure of the regulator, additional
overpressure protection is required.
A regulator may vent some gas to
the atmosphere. In hazardous or
flammable gas service, vented gas may
accumulate and cause personal injury,
death or property damage due to fire or
explosion. Vent a regulator in hazardous
gas service to a remote, safe location
away from air intakes or any hazardous
area. The vent line or stack opening
must be protected against condensation
or clogging.
Before installing a Type 67D, 67DR, 67DS, 67DSR,
67DF, 67DFR, 67DFS or 67DFSR Regulator, be
sure the installation complies with the following
installation guidelines:
1. Regulator operation within ratings does not
preclude the possibility of damage from debris
in the lines or from external sources. Regulators
should be inspected for damage periodically and
after any overpressure condition.
2. Only personnel qualified through training and
experience should install, operate and maintain
the regulator. Make sure that there is no damage
to or foreign material in the regulator. Also ensure
that all tubing and piping is free of debris.
3. Install the regulator so that flow is from the IN to the
OUT connection as marked on the regulator body.
4. A clogged spring case vent hole may cause the
regulator to function improperly. To keep this
vent hole from being plugged (and to keep the
5
67D Series
spring case from collecting moisture, corrosive
chemicals or other foreign material) orient the
vent to the lowest possible point on the spring
case or otherwise protect it. Inspect the vent hole
regularly to make sure it is not plugged. Spring
case vent hole orientation may be changed by
rotating the spring case with respect to the body. A
1/4 NPT spring case vent may be remotely vented
by installing obstruction-free tubing or piping into
the vent. Protect the remote vent by installing
a screened vent cap on the remote end of the
vent pipe.
5. For use in regulator shutdown, install upstream
block and vent valves and downstream block and
vent valves (if required), or provide some other
suitable means of properly venting the regulator
inlet and outlet pressures. Install a pressure gauge
to monitor instruments on startup.
6. Apply a good grade of pipe compound to the
external pipe threads before making connections,
making sure not to get the pipe compound inside
the regulator.
7. Install tubing fitting or piping into the 1/2 NPT
inlet connection on the body (key 1) and into the
1/2 NPT body outlet connection.
8. The two 1/4 NPT outlets can be used for a gauge
or other use. If not used, they must be plugged.
Overpressure Protection
The 67D Series Regulators have maximum outlet
pressure ratings that are lower than their maximum
inlet pressure ratings. A pressure-relieving or
pressure- limiting device is needed if inlet pressure
can exceed the maximum outlet pressure rating.
Types 67DR, 67DSR, 67DFR and 67DFSR have
a low capacity internal relief valve for minor seat
leakage only. Other overpressure protection must be
provided if the maximum inlet pressure can exceed
the maximum pressure rating of the downstream
equipment or exceeds the maximum outlet pressure
rating of the regulator.
Startup and Adjustment
Key numbers are referenced in Figures 3 through 8.
1. With proper installation completed and downstream
equipment properly adjusted, slowly open the
upstream and downstream block valve (when used)
while using pressure gauges to monitor pressure.
▲ WARNING
To avoid personal injury, property
damage or equipment damage caused
by bursting of pressure-containing
parts or explosion of accumulated
gas, never adjust the control spring
to produce an outlet pressure higher
than the upper limit of the outlet
pressure range for that particular
spring. If the desired outlet pressure
is not within the range of the control
spring, install a spring of the proper
range according to the diaphragm parts
maintenance procedure.
2. If outlet pressure adjustment is necessary,
monitor outlet pressure with a gauge during the
adjustment procedure. The regulator is adjusted
by loosening the hex nut (key 19), if used, and
turning the adjusting screw or handwheel (key 18)
clockwise to increase or counterclockwise to
decrease the outlet pressure setting. Retighten the
hex nut to maintain the adjustment position.
Shutdown
First, close the nearest upstream block valve and
then close the nearest downstream block valve
(when used). Next, open the downstream vent valve.
Since the regulator remains open in response to the
decreasing downstream pressure, pressure between
the closed block valves will be released through the
open vent valve.
Maintenance
Regulator parts are subject to normal wear and
must be inspected and replaced as necessary. The
frequency of inspection and replacement of parts
depends on the severity of service conditions and
applicable codes and government regulations. Open
the Type 67DF, 67DFR, 67DFS or 67DFSR drain valve
(key 2) regularly to empty accumulated liquid from the
dripwell (key 5).
Note
If sufficient clearance exists, the body
(key 1) may remain mounted on other
equipment or in a line or panel during
maintenance unless the entire regulator
will be replaced.

67D Series
▲ WARNING
To avoid personal injury, property
damage or equipment damage caused
by sudden release of pressure or
explosion of accumulated gas, do
not attempt any maintenance or
disassembly without first isolating the
regulator from system pressure and
relieving all internal pressure from
the regulator.
