Product Description
The 6350 Series pilots have been designed to
ensure maximum pressure control accuracy and
fast response in a wide variety of applications:
natural gas distribution systems; fuel gas supply to
industrial boilers, furnaces, ovens, and mixers; and
large commercial/industrial establishments such as
shopping centers and schools. They can also be used
in plant air and in liquid service.

6350 Series
Principle of Operation
Pilot-operated regulators use inlet pressure as the
operating medium, which is reduced through pilot
operation to load the actuator diaphragm. Outlet or
downstream pressure opposes loading pressure in the
actuator and also opposes the pilot control spring.
In operation, assume that outlet pressure is below
the pilot control setting. Control spring force on
the pilot diaphragm thus opens the pilot valve plug
providing additional loading pressure to the actuator
diaphragm. This loading pressure forces the actuator
stem forward, opening the main valve plug via a bump
connection. The upward motion of the plug allows gas
to flow through the cage into the downstream system.
When downstream demand has been satisfied, outlet
pressure will increase, acting on the pilot and actuator
diaphragm. This pressure exceeds the pilot control
spring setting, moving the pilot diaphragm away and
letting the valve plug spring (Type 6351) or bellows
(Types 6352 through 6354M pilots) close the pilot
valve plug (unbalanced in the Type 6351 but balanced
in the Types 6352 through 6354M pilots). Excess
loading pressure on the actuator diaphragm escapes
downstream through the bleed hole (Type 6351 pilot)
or restriction (Types 6352 through 6354M pilots).
Reduced actuator loading pressure permits the main
valve to close. The combination of main valve spring
force and valve plug unbalance provides positive valve
plug shutoff against the port and upper seals.
All 6350 Series pilots have an internal check valve
that allows loading pressure to bleed downstream at
approximately 25 psig / 1.7 bar differential across the
actuator diaphragm.

Installation and Startup
1. Use qualified personnel when installing, operating
and maintaining pilots. Before installing, inspect
pilot and tubing, for any shipment damage or
foreign material that may have collected during
crating and shipment. Make certain that body is
clean and the pipelines are free of foreign material.
In hazardous or flammable gas service,
vented gas may accumulate, and cause
personal injury, death, or property
damage due to fire or explosion.
Vent a regulator in hazardous gas
service to a remote, safe location away
from air intakes or any hazardous
location. The vent line or stack opening
must be protected against condensation
or clogging.
2. To keep the pilot spring case vent from being
plugged or the spring case from collecting moisture,
corrosive chemicals, or other foreign material, point
the vent down or otherwise protect it. To remotely
vent the standard pilot, remove the vent and install
obstruction-free tubing or piping into the 1/4 NPT
vent tapping. Provide protection on a remote vent
by installing a screened vent cap into the remote
end of the vent pipe.
3. Run a 3/8 in. / 9.5 mm outer diameter or larger
pilot supply line from the upstream pipeline to
the filter inlet. Do not make the upstream pipeline
connection in a turbulent area, such as near a
nipple, swage, or elbow. If the maximum pilot inlet
pressure could exceed the pilot rating, install a
separate reducing regulator in the pilot supply line.
Install a hand valve in the pilot supply line, and
provide vent valves to properly isolate and relieve
the pressure from the regulator.
Introduce pilot supply pressure into
the regulator before introducing any
downstream pressure, or internal damage
may occur due to reverse pressurization
of the pilot and main valve components.
4. Pressure setting of pilot control spring: Turning
the adjusting screw clockwise into the spring
case increases the spring compression
and pressure setting. Turning the adjusting
screw counterclockwise decreases the spring
compression and pressure setting.
Pilot Adjustment
To adjust standard 6350 Series pilots: loosen the
locknut and turn the adjusting screw. Then tighten
the locknut to maintain the adjustment position. A
closing cap must be removed before adjustment and
replaced afterward.
To avoid possible personal injury from
a pressure-loaded pilot, carefully vent
the spring case before removing the
closing cap. Otherwise, trapped loading
pressure could forcefully eject the freed
closing cap.
Maintenance
Pilot parts are subject to normal wear and must be
inspected and replaced as necessary. The frequency
of inspection and replacement of parts depends upon
the severity of service conditions or the requirements
of local, state, and federal regulations. Due to the
care Fisher™ takes in meeting all manufacturing
requirements (heat treating, dimensional tolerances,
etc.), use only replacement parts manufactured or
furnished by Fisher.
All O-rings, gaskets, and seals should be lubricated
with a good grade of general purpose grease and
installed gently rather than forced into position. Be
certain that the nameplates are updated to accurately
indicate any field changes in equipment, materials,
service conditions, or pressure settings.
To avoid personal injury resulting
from sudden release of pressure,
isolate the regulator from all pressure
and cautiously release trapped
pressure from the regulator before
attempting disassembly.
