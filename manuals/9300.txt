for Anderson Greenwood Series 9300 Pilot
Operated Safety Relief Valves (POSRV).
The intent of these instructions is to acquaint
the user with the storage, installation and
operation of this product. Please read these
instructions carefully before installation.
Safety Precautions
When the safety valve is under pressure
never place any part of your body near
the outlet/exhaust of the valve.
The valve outlet and any separate drains should
be piped or vented to a safe location.
Always wear proper safety gear to protect hands,
head, eyes, ears, etc. anytime you are near
pressurized valves.
Never attempt to remove the safety valve from
a system that is pressurized.
Never make adjustments to or perform
maintenance on the safety valve while in service
unless the valve is isolated from the system
pressure. If not properly isolated from the system
pressure, the safety valve may inadvertently open
resulting in serious injury.
Remove the safety valve prior to performing any
pressure testing of the system.
The safety of lives and property often depends on
the proper operation of the safety valve. The valve
must be maintained according to appropriate
instructions and must be periodically tested and
reconditioned to ensure correct function.

Anderson Greenwood Series 9300 Pilot Operated Safety Relief Valves
Installation and Maintenance Instructions
1 Introduction
1.1 Description of valve
The Series 9300 employs the highly successful
pressurized PTFE film seat, as well as
protected FEP diaphragms. The design allows
these valves to be used in the pilot operated
pressure relief mode and simultaneously
provide vacuum relief, either via weight loads
of the internals, or with a specific pilot control
of the vacuum opening. The Series 9300
was designed with a special studded inlet
connection to reduce the inlet profile, and
coupled with larger orifice areas, these valves
provide flow capacities as much as 45% greater
than the Series 90 valves. The Series 9300 is
a full body valve to pipe away the discharge if
required.
1.1.1 Pilot operated safety relief valve with
non-flowing modulating pilot
• 9340P - Positive pressure relief valve
• 9340C - Positive and negative pressure relief
valve
• 9304V - Negative pressure relief valve
Pilot operated valves use a pilot to control
pressure over a large unbalanced member in
the main valve, such as a diaphragm piston.
The large overbalance means a much larger
force on top of the seat compared to process
forces pushing up on the seat. At set pressure,
the pilot relieves the pressure quickly,
permitting the main valve seat to open rapidly.
All of the pilots have the same construction,
except for the location of the connections
to the main valve diaphragm actuators, or
the connections for the pressure sense.
For either the 9340P or the 9340C, the pilot
controls only the positive pressure relief.
The negative pressure relief is controlled by
the weight of the parts that move in the main
valve when it opens. In the 9304V, the pilot
controls the negative pressure relief.
1.1.2 Pilot operated safety relief valve with flowing
modulating or snap action pilot
• 9390P - Positive pressure relief valve
• 9390C - Positive and negative pressure relief
valve
• 9309V - Negative pressure relief valve
Weighted-loaded and spring operated valves
open as process forces overcome downward
forces, with little flexibility to overcome
problem applications. Anderson Greenwood
pilot operated valves can be adjusted to open
with a rapid ‘snap’ action or modulating action.
Most applications are well served by the snap
action mode, with full opening at set pressure
and full reseating after a short blowdown.
However, some systems might best be served
by a proportional opening, whereby the valve
opens just enough to satisfy small upsets
and maintain constant system pressure, yet
still have the capability to reach full capacity
within 10% overpressure. The 9390C and 9309V
pilots have the same construction except for
the location of the connections for the pressure
sense. For either the 9390P or 9390C, the pilot
controls only the positive pressure relief.
In the 9309V, pressure relief is controlled
by the weight of the parts that move in the
main valve when it opens. The pilot controls
the negative pressure relief on the negative
pressure relief valve. The Anderson Greenwood
9390 Series can be set for a snap acting or
modulating mode with a simple adjustment of
the external blowdown screw. No part changes
are necessary to change the operating mode.

2 Main Valve
2.1 General main valve maintenance
Since the Series 9300 valve can be either a
pressure only, vacuum only, or pressure/
vacuum relieving device, it is built in a modular
fashion. The standard single diaphragm unit
will function on pressure and vacuum, however,
opening under very low vacuum requires use of
the auxiliary diaphragm chamber. The valve can
also be repaired in a modular fashion. The seat
can be replaced without complete disassembly
of the diaphragm cases. Selective repair can be
performed as required.
Prior to disassembly of the main valve
or pilot, it is recommended to stamp or
mark the location of the pilot, and the
orientation of the diaphragm cases, studs,
and column supports to the main valve body.
1.6 Basic pilot series for the 9300 main valve
1.6.1 Series 91 Pilot
The Series 91 was designed for specific
applications where FEP diaphragms alone were
not rugged enough and premium sealing was
required for super cryogenic fluids. Series 91
design includes stainless steel (SS), and PTFE
diaphragms which provide extraordinary
performance for hard to hold cryogenic fluids.
1.6.2 Series 93 Pilot
The Series 93 is a pilot operated pressure
relief valve designed with elastomer seats
and seals, and construction materials in
aluminum (AL), carbon steel (CS), and stainless
steel (SS). These construction materials satisfy
the majority of gas piping and chemical tank
applications. The Series 93 pilot can be used
on any Series 9000 valve except a combination
9000 larger than 6”.
1.6.3 Series 93T Pilot
The Series 93T was an offshoot of the Series
93, designed specifically for cryogenic and
chemical applications where an elastomer seal
is not satisfactory.
1.6.4 Series 400B
The Series 400B is used with 8”, 10”, and
12” combination weight-loaded vacuum and
pressure valves where quick relieving of dual
chamber diaphragms is required to open
the main valve.
2.2 Main valve single chamber diaphragm
disassembly (Refer to figure 1)
1. Remove the pilot (as a unit) and the tubing
from the diaphragm case. Set them aside.
Note: match mark orientation of tubing and
case assembly to the body. This will assist in
reassembly.
2. Unscrew the case bolts (700/710) and
remove the upper diaphragm case (210).
3. On valve sizes 2” through 4”, remove the
diaphragm assembly, lower case (280), shaft
(320) and seat plate assembly from the main
valve body (100).
4. On valve sizes 6” and larger, remove seat
plate assembly from shaft (320) prior to
removing diaphragm assembly, lower
case (280), and shaft (320). To remove, spin
diaphragm plate assembly counterclockwise
while holding seat plate assembly stationary
until shaft (320) is free of seat hub (420).
The seat plate assembly should then rest on
nozzle (460).
5. On valve sizes 6” and larger, remove
diaphragm assembly and shaft (320) from
lower case (280). Then remove lower case
from the body (100).
6. On valve sizes 6” and larger, lift seat plate
assembly from the body (100).
Caution
When removing seat plate assembly, be careful
not to damage the nozzle (460).
7. Unscrew counterclockwise the seat plate
assembly from the main shaft (320). This is
normally a hand operation, however, a 9/16”
(14.3 mm) wrenching flat is provided on the
seat hub (420). The connecting thread will
run free, then tighten, and run free again as
it disengages from a locking helicoil (330)
in the vertical shaft (320). This will allow the
seat plate assembly, diaphragm assembly
and lower case (280) to be separated.
This practice will ensure proper alignment and
location of parts during reassembly.
To prevent mixing up parts it is recommended
to repair the main valve and pilot in stages.
For this reason, the diaphragm, nozzle, and seat
maintenance and/or replacement instructions
are separate from the pilot instructions.
8. Holding the shaft (320) stationary, remove
the jam nut (520) from the diaphragm
assembly. Remove the diaphragms
(170, 175, 950, 960), washers (580, 590, 600),
gaskets (620), plates (150, 160), and lower
case (280) (as a unit) from the shaft (320).

2.3 Main valve dual chamber diaphragm
disassembly (refer to figure 2)
1. Remove the pilot and tubing from
the auxiliary diaphragm case.
Note: match mark orientation of tubing and
case assembly with the body. This will assist
in reassembly.
2. Unscrew the upper auxiliary case bolts
(700) and nuts (730), and remove the upper
auxiliary diaphragm case (210B).
3. Install a 6” to 8” long braided wire through
the hole at the top of the lift rod (250) to retain
the lift rod (250). (See Figure 3, detail C)
4. Lift the auxiliary (160B, 170B, 290) and main
diaphragm (150, 160A, 170A) assemblies
to the full open position using the auxiliary
vacuum plate (160B). The open dome port
can be temporarily capped to hold the main
diaphragm assembly open.
5. Remove nuts (530 and 520B) and PTFE
O-ring (670). (See Figure 3, detail A).
6. The lift rod (250) is attached to the auxiliary
plate bushing (240) with threads. Unscrew
the lift rod (250) from the bushing (240) by
turning the rod (250) clockwise until it drops
down into the main valve shaft bore (320).
7. Remove the main diaphragm case bolts
(700, 710). Remove the studs (810) from
the body (100). Remove the lower auxiliary
diaphragm case (280B) and the upper main
diaphragm case (220) as a unit, which is
assembled to the diaphragm case adapter
(230). Allow the lift rod (250) to slip from
the center hole and lift the lower auxiliary
diaphragm case (280B), upper main
diaphragm case (220), and adapter (230)
upwards as one unit.
Caution
Be careful not to bend the lift rod (250) during
case assembly removal.
8. On valve sizes 2” through 4”, remove
the diaphragm assembly (150, 160A, 170A),
lower case (280), shaft (320) and seat plate
assembly (910, 920) from the main valve
body (100).
9. On valve sizes 6” and larger, remove seat
plate assembly (910, 920) from shaft (320)
prior to removing diaphragm assembly
(150, 160A, 170A), lower case (280) and
shaft (320). To remove, spin diaphragm
plates (150, 160A, 170A) assembly
counterclockwise while holding seat plate
(910, 920) assembly stationary until shaft
(320) is free of seat hub (420). The seat plate
(910, 920) assembly should then rest on
nozzle (460).
10. On valve sizes 6” and larger, remove
diaphragm assembly (150, 160A, 170A) and
shaft (320) from lower case (280A). Then
remove lower (280A) case from the body (100).
11. On valve sizes 6” and larger, lift seat plate
(910, 920) assembly from the body (100).
Caution
When removing seat plate assembly (910, 920),
be careful not to damage the nozzle (460).
12.Unscrew counterclockwise the seat
plate (910, 920) assembly from the main
shaft (320). This is normally a hand
operation, however, a 9/16” (14.3 mm)
wrenching flat is provided on the seat
hub (420). The connecting thread will
run free, then tighten, and run free again
as it disengages from a locking helicoil
(330) in the vertical shaft (320). This will
allow the seat plate assembly (910, 920),
diaphragm (150, 160A, 170A) assembly and
lower case (280A) to be separated.
13.Holding the shaft (320) stationary,
remove the jam nut (520A) from the
diaphragm (150, 160A, 170A) assembly.
Remove the diaphragms (170A, 175A, 950,
960), washers (580, 590, 600), gaskets
(620A), plates (150A, 160A), and lower

2.6.1 Single chamber diaphragm replacement
(See Figure 3, detail D)
1. Secure the main valve shaft (320) wrenching
surface in a soft jaw vise. Caution should be
taken when securing aluminum shaft (320)
to prevent destroying the part.
2. Remove jam nut (520) by turning it
counterclockwise.
3. Note: mark plates as top (vacuum) and
bottom (pressure) prior to disassembly.
Remove the following parts in this order:
washer (580), vacuum plate (160),
washer (590), diaphragm (170), *slipper/
reinforcement diaphragm (950,960/175)
(see notes for configuration variances),
pressure plate (150), and PTFE washer (600).
Note: on single chamber valves with high
pressure stainless steel internals, an outer
(950) and inner (960) diaphragm slipper is
used to protect the diaphragm (170) from
wear. The outer slipper (950) is between
the diaphragm (170) and lower case (280).
The inner slipper (960) is between the
diaphragm (170) and the pressure plate (150).
Note: on 2” and 3” single and dual chamber
valves with low pressure aluminum or low
pressure stainless steel internals, use a
reinforcement diaphragm (175) between
the main diaphragm (170) and lower case
(280). The reinforcement diaphragm (175)
is recognized by a small offset hole at
the center of the diaphragm.
Caution
Installing the reinforcement diaphragm (175)
in the wrong location will cause damage to
the diaphragm assembly.
4. Inspect plates (150, 160) for cracks,
warpage. Clean all metal parts with oil free
solvent, and dry with lint free towel.
5. Proceed with this step only on disassembly of
main valve dual diaphragms. Inspect lift rod
(250) straightness and ensure small diameter
tip is not damaged. Also raise the lift rod (250)
up and check the surface for damage.
6. Proceed with this step only on disassembly
of main valve dual diaphragms. Install 6” to
8” of braided stiff wire through the hole at
the top of the lift rod (250). This will aid in
reassembly of auxiliary diaphragm.
7. Install new PTFE washer (600), pressure
plate (150), *slipper/reinforcement
diaphragm (950,960/175) (radius side down)
(see notes for configuration variances),
diaphragm (170), flat washer (590), vacuum
plate (160), flat washer (580), and jam nut (520).
Note: on single chamber valves with high
pressure stainless steel internals, an outer
(950) and inner (960) diaphragm slipper is
used to protect the diaphragm (170) from
wear. The outer slipper (950) is between
the diaphragm (170) and lower case (280).
The inner slipper (960) is between the
diaphragm (170) and the pressure plate (150).
Note: on 2” and 3” single and dual chamber
valves with low pressure aluminum or low
pressure stainless steel internals, use a
reinforcement diaphragm (175) between
the main diaphragm (170) and lower case
(280). The reinforcement diaphragm (175)
is recognized by a small offset hole at
the center of the diaphragm.
Caution
Installing the reinforcement diaphragm (175)
in the wrong location will cause damage to
the diaphragm assembly.
8. Tighten jam nut (520), wrench tight.
5. Inspect threaded parts and sealing surfaces
and if damaged replace. Otherwise, clean all
metal parts with oil free solvent and dry with
lint free towel.
6. The new seat film (610) is pre-molded.
To install, secure the wrenching flat of
the seat hub (420) into a vise and install
the protector plate (920), PTFE seat film
(610) (radius side down), seat bushing (430),
spacer (640), seat plate (910) (radius side up),
and install the jam nut (450) HAND TIGHT.
Caution
Tightening the jam nut (450) prior to stretching
the film (610) will cause ripples in the film.
(See Figure 5, Detail E)
7. Remove the seat hub (420) from the vise
and install it into the fixture. Then install
the seat retainer (140) (beveled side down)
onto the seat film (610), and then install
the clamp band (125) and tighten.
8. Using a heat gun, apply heat to the seat film
(610) in a circular motion approximately 2” to
3” above surface until all ripples and creases
are gone. This usually takes less than 1 minute.
Now tighten jam nut (450) wrench tight.
9. Trim excess film (610) from back side of seat
plate (910) to complete reassembly process.

3.5 Pilot adjustment for non-flowing
modulating pilots (Series 400B)
The pilot may be set separate from the main
valve provided there is access to a pilot test
system similar to the one shown in Figure 14.
3.5.1 Adjustment of set pressure
1. Install the pilot valve onto the pilot test
system and attach gage sensing lines to
the supply and dome connections.
2. Remove cap.
3. Screw the set pressure adjustment screw
clockwise until it is screwed IN 80% to 90%.
4. Increase the supply pressure to nameplate
setting and slowly back out the adjustment
screw until flow through the pilot exhaust
begins.
5. Continue to back the set pressure
adjustment screw out until the dome
pressure is 70% of the supply pressure.
When the dome pressure reaches 70% of
the supply pressure read the supply gage
pressure. If it is below set pressure, you will
need to tighten down on the pressure screw,
or back off it if you are high. Tighten the locknut
once the desired set pressure is achieved.
Note: adjust the set pressure for 101% ± 1%
of the nameplate set pressure.
6. Cycle the pilot valve a minimum of 5 times
to assure that the dome pressure reduction
at set pressure is consistent. Increase
the pressure very slowly in order to obtain
an accurate reading of the cracking
pressure and to expose any erratic
performance.
Note: cracking pressure on vacuum pilots
is that pressure at which the initial dome
pressure change is noted.
7. Hold the pilot valve at set pressure to obtain
the dome pressure reading.
Note: the first 6 steps should be
completed before this step is undertaken.
In modulating 400B pilots, the dome
pressure decreases proportional to increase
in inlet pressure.
 Full dome reduction (dome pressure)
occurs ≤ 6% over pressure.
8. Check the pilot exhaust for leakage when
the pilot is in null position between crack
and reseat.
Note: maximum leakage allowed is
60 bubbles per minute.
3.5.2 Reseat pressure
Reseat is defined as that supply pressure when
the dome pressure is 75% of the supply pressure.
Note: blowdown adjustment is not required on
Series 400B pilots.
3.5.3 Adjustment Tolerances

3.6 Pilot adjustment for flowing modulating or
snap action pilots (Series 91, 93, and 93T pilots)
The pilot may be set separate from the main
valve provided there is access to a pilot test
system similar to the one shown in Figure 14.
3.6.1 Adjustment of set pressure
1. Install the pilot valve onto the pilot test
system, and attach gage sensing lines to
the supply and dome connections.
2. Remove the cap.
3. Screw the set pressure adjustment screw
clockwise until it is screwed in 80% to 90%.
4. Increase the supply pressure to nameplate
setting and slowly back out the set pressure
adjustment screw until flow through the pilot
exhaust begins.
5. Continue to back the set pressure adjustment
screw out until the dome pressure is 70%
of the supply pressure. When the dome
pressure reaches 70% of the supply
pressure read the supply gage pressure.
If it is below set pressure, you will need to
tighten down on the pressure screw, or back
off it if you are high. Tighten the locknut
once the desired set pressure is achieved.
Note: set pressure on a vacuum pilot is
evidenced by a rapid change of the dome
pressure (0 gage) to the supply pressure.
A slow ramp speed is recommended on low
set valves in order to obtain true reading of
set pressure.
6. Check the pilot exhaust vent for leakage.
The pilot shall be bubble tight up to crack
pressure shown in 3.6.3. Also, check upper
pilot vent for leakage. There should be
0 leakage from the upper vent.
3.6.2 Reseat pressure
1. Turn the blowdown adjusting screw
clockwise to decrease the reseat pressure
or counterclockwise to increase the reseat
pressure.
2. A small interaction between set pressure
and reseat pressure adjustments will occur;
therefore, it may be necessary to readjust
the set pressure after setting reseat pressure.

Modulating action -7” WC to -1.0 psig ± 3% 90% 100%
Modulating action -1.0 PSI to -14.7 psig ± 3% 95% 100%
Note: if the blowdown adjusting screw has
been removed or turned to either extreme,
positioning it midway will aid in obtaining
the correct reseat pressure. There are
approximately 7 to 8 turns to obtain full travel
of the adjustment. Midway from either end
should produce a blowdown for snap action.
 For modulating pilot action, back the
adjustment screw out counterclockwise.
3. Cycle the pilot valve a minimum of 5
times to assure that dome pressure
reduction at set pressure is consistent.
Increase the pressure very slowly in order to
obtain an accurate reading of the cracking
pressure and to expose any erratic
performance.
Note: cracking pressure on vacuum pilots
is that pressure at which the initial dome
pressure change is noted.
4. Hold the pilot valve at set pressure to obtain
the dome pressure reading. For modulating
pilots, dome pressure shall be read with
the inlet at 105% of set pressure.
Note: the first 4 steps should be completed
before this step is undertaken.
 On snap action pilots, the dome pressure
decreases rapidly with a “snap” to
15% ± 10% of set pressure.
 On modulating action pilots (Series 90),
the dome pressure decreases slowly to
30% ± 5% of set pressure and recovers to
60% ± 10% of set pressure at set pressure.
5. After desired pilot action is set, verify pilot
seat tightness. This is accomplished by
checking the pilot exhaust vent for leakage.
The pilot should be bubble tight up to crack
pressure as shown in 3.6.3. Be aware
of crack pressure changes between set
pressure ranges.

Installation and Maintenance Instructions
4 Functional testing of complete
assembly of main valve and pilot
4.1 General
Assemble the pilot to the main valve, and
install remaining tubing and accessories.
The complete valve assembly should be leak
tested for internal and external leaks using
a pressure equal to 30% and 90% of set.
4.1.1 Leakage check - pressure relief valves
Apply pressure to the inlet equal to 30% of
the set pressure. Check for leakage at the
main valve seat, no visible leakage shall occur.
Hold time is 1 minute.
Increase the inlet pressure to 90% of the set
pressure. Check for leakage at the cap seal,
casting, pilot support pipe and supply tube and
other applicable connections using leak test
solution and at the main valve seat. No visible
leakage shall occur for a hold time of 1 minute.
4.1.2 Leakage check - vacuum relief valves
Valves equipped with vacuum pilots shall be
leak tested per 4.1.1 on positive pressure with
the set pressure equal to the reciprocal of
the vacuum set pressure. Valves with weighted
diaphragms shall be tested for leakage at 50%
of their weighted set.
4.1.3 Back flow preventers and/or field test
The use of some field test connection or
back flow preventers necessitates the use of
check valves. These valves shall be installed
per the applicable assembly drawings and in
the free flow direction shall open at less than
.5” W.C. The check valves may be tested for
forward flow either before or after assembly
at the shops option. The output check valve of
back flow preventers shall be checked for zero
leakage per 4.1.1 paragraph 2.
4.2 Leakage check - pressure relief valves
pressure pilot (Series 400B pilot)
1. Connect gas bottle as shown in Figure 15.
2. Close valve “C”.
3. Open block valve “B” to supply regulator.
Note: regulator pressure should be set at 0.
4. Connect bubble tester bottle to pilot exhaust
vent and block the second pilot vent if
the pilot is equipped with one.
5. Increase pressure at field test port to
slightly above tank pressure by slowly
increasing regulated pressure.
6. Open field test valve “A” and slowly increase
regulator pressure until bubbles are seen in
the bottle. That pressure will be within 3% of
the set pressure.
7. To remove the test set-up, close valves “A”

4.3 Field test instructions for flowing
modulating or snap action pilots
4.3.1 General
An optional field test accessory is available
for checking the positive set pressure without
removing the valve from service. The field test
accessory consists of a 3-way ball valve to allow
the pilot to sense pressure from either the
process or from the test gas source.
A standard bottle of nitrogen equipped with
a pressure regulator, block valve, pressure
gage, and convenient length of high pressure
flexible hose is recommended for testing. A set
up similar to that shown in Figure 13 should be
used. Such a test kit is available from Anderson
Greenwood under the part number 04.4812.001
plus additional dash numbers for the pressure
gages required.
4.3.2 Field test procedure for flowing modulating
or snap action pilots
1. Connect the gas bottle as shown in Figure 16.
2. Close vent valve “C”.
3. Open block valve “B” to supply regulator.
Note: regulator pressure should be set at 0.
4. Connect bubble tester bottle to pilot exhaust
vent.
5. Increase pressure at field test port to
slightly above tank pressure by slowly
increasing regulated pressure.
6. Open field test valve “A” and slowly increase
regulator pressure until bubbles are seen in
the bottle. That pressure will be within 10%
of the set pressure.
Note: for pilots adjusted for snap action, the
main valve seat will open at set pressure
if the tank pressure is present. If it is not,
a sudden increase in pilot exhaust flow will
be observed at set pressure.
7. To remove the test set-up, close valves “A”
and “B” and open valve “C”.

5 Storage and handling
Because cleanliness is essential to
the satisfactory operation and tightness of
a Series 9000 pilot operated relief valve,
precautions should be taken to keep out all
foreign particles and materials. Valves should
be closed off properly at both the valve inlet
and outlet. Particular care should be taken
to keep the valve inlet absolutely clean.
Valves should preferably be stored indoors
with the original factory installed protective
measures left in place. This includes all
desiccants, flange protectors, and factory seals.
