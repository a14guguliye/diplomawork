Manager, or LOI ensures all transmitter components are in working order prior to
installation.
The transmitter can be configured either on-line or off-line using a Field
Communicator, AMS Device Manager, or the optional LOI (head-mount and fieldmount). During on-line configuration, the transmitter is connected to a Field
communicator. Data is entered in the working register of the communicator and
sent directly to the transmitter.
Off-line configuration consists of storing configuration data in a Field
Communicator while it is not connected to a transmitter. Data is stored in
nonvolatile memory and can be downloaded to the transmitter at a later time.
2.4.1  Configuring on the bench
To configure on the bench, required equipment includes a power supply, a digital
multimeter (DMM), and Field Communicator, AMS Device Manager, or a LOI –
option M4.
Connect the equipment as shown in Figure 2-1. Connect HART®
 Communication
leads at any termination point in the signal loop. To ensure successful HART
Communication, a resistance of at least 250 ohms must be present between the
transmitter and the power supply. Connect the Field Communicator leads to the
clips behind the power (+,–) terminals on the top of the device. Avoid exposing
the transmitter electronics to the plant environment after installation by setting
all transmitter jumpers during the commissioning stage on the bench.

• A Field Communicator may be connected at any termination point in the
signal loop. The signal loop must have between 250 and 1100 ohms load for
communications.
• Max torque is 6 in-lb (0.7 N-m).
2.4.2  Selecting a configuration tool
Field Communicator
The Field Communicator is a handheld device that exchanges information with
the transmitter from the control room, the instrument site, or any wiring
termination point in the loop. To facilitate communication, connect the Field
Communicator, shown in this manual, in parallel with the transmitter (see Figure
2-1). Use the loop connection ports on the rear panel of the Field Communicator.
The connections are non-polarized. Do not make connections to the serial port
or the nickel cadmium (NiCd) recharger jack in explosive atmospheres. Before
connecting the Field Communicator in an explosive atmosphere make sure the
instruments in the loop are installed in accordance with intrinsically safe or nonincendive field wiring practices.
There are two interfaces available with the Field Communicator: Traditional
and Dashboard interfaces. All steps using a Field Communicator will be using
Dashboard interfaces. Figure 2-2 shows the Device Dashboard interface. As stated
in System readiness, it is critical that the latest DD’s are loaded into the Field
Communicator for optimal transmitter performance.
Visit Emerson.com/Rosemount to download latest DD library.
Turn on the Field Communicator by pressing the ON/OFF key. The Field
Communicator will search for a HART®
-compatible device and indicate when the
connection is made. If the Field Communicator fails to connect, it indicates that no
device was found. If this occurs, refer to Troubleshooting.

AMS Device Manager
With an AMS Device Manager software package, you can commission and
configure instruments, monitor status and alerts, troubleshoot from the control
room, perform advanced diagnostics, manage calibration, and automatically
document activities with a single application.
Full configuration capability with AMS Device Manager requires loading the
most current Device Descriptor (DD) for this device. Download the latest DD at
Emerson.com/Rosemount or Fieldcomm.org.
Note
All steps listed in this product manual using AMS Device Manager assume the use
of Version 11.5.
Local Operator Interface (LOI)
• The LOI requires option code M4 to be ordered.
• To activate the LOI, push either configuration button. Configuration buttons
are located on the LCD display (remove the housing cover to access the
interface. See Table 2-2 for configuration button functionality and Figure 2-3
for configuration button location).
When using the LOI for configuration, several features require multiple screens
for a successful configuration. Data entered will be saved on a screen-by-screen
basis; the LOI will indicate this by flashing SAVED on the LCD display each time.
Note
Entering into the LOI menu effectively disables the ability to write to the device
by any other host or configuration tool. Ensure this is communicated to necessary
personnel before using the LOI for device configuration.

LOI password
An LOI password can be entered and enabled to prevent review and modification
of device configuration via the LOI. This does not prevent configuration from
HART®
 or through the control system. The LOI password is a four-digit code that
is to be set by the user. If the password is lost or forgotten the master password
is “9307”. The LOI password can be configured and enabled/disabled by HART
communication via a Field Communicator, AMS Device Manager, or the LOI.
2.4.3  Setting the loop to manual
When sending or requesting data that would disrupt the loop or change the
output of the transmitter, set the process application loop to manual. The Field
Communicator, AMS Device Manager, or LOI will prompt you to set the loop to
manual when necessary. Acknowledging this prompt does not set the loop to
manual. The prompt is only a reminder; set the loop to manual as a separate
operation.
2.4.4  Failure mode
As part of normal operation, each transmitter continuously monitors its own
performance. This automatic diagnostics routine is a timed series of checks
repeated continuously. If diagnostics detect an input sensor failure or a failure
in the transmitter electronics, the transmitter drives its output to low or high
depending on the position of the failure mode switch. If the sensor temperature
is outside the range limits, the transmitter saturates its output to 3.9 mA
for standard configuration on the low end (3.8 mA if configured for NAMURcompliant operation) and 20.5 mA on the high end (or NAMUR-compliant).
These values are also custom configurable by the factory or using the Field
Communicator. The values to which the transmitter drives its output in failure
mode depend on whether it is configured to standard, NAMUR-compliant, or
custom operation. See Rosemount 644 Temperature Transmitter Product Data
Sheet for standard and NAMUR-compliant operation parameters.

2.6.3  2-wire RTD offset
The 2-wire offset feature allows the measured lead wire resistance to be input
and corrected for, which results in the transmitter adjusting its temperature
measurement for the error caused by this added resistance. Because of a lack of
lead wire compensation within the RTD, temperature measurements made with a
2-wire RTD are often inaccurate.
This feature can be configured as a subset of the sensor configuration process in
the Field Communicator, AMS Device Manager, and the LOI.
To utilize this feature properly perform the following steps:
Procedure
1. Measure the lead wire resistance of both RTD leads after installing the
2-wire RTD and transmitter.
2. Navigate to the 2-wire RTD offset parameter.
3. Enter the total measured resistance of the two RTD leads at the 2-wire
offset prompt to ensure proper adjustment. The transmitter will adjust
its temperature measurement to correct the error caused by lead wire
resistance.

Note
If Sensor 1 and/or Sensor 2 should fail while PV is configured for average
temperature and Hot Backup™
 is not enabled, the transmitter will go into
alarm. For this reason, it is recommended when PV is Sensor Average, that
Hot Backup be enabled when dual-element sensors are used, or when two
temperature measurements are taken from the same point in the process. If a
sensor failure occurs when Hot Backup is enabled, while PV is Sensor Average,
three scenarios could result:
— If Sensor 1 fails, the average will only be reading from Sensor 2, the working
sensor
Configuration Reference Manual
January 2023 00809-0200-4728
30 Emerson.com/Rosemount
— If Sensor 2 fails, the average will only be reading from Sensor 1, the working
sensor
— If both sensors fail simultaneously, the transmitter will go into alarm and
the status available (via HART®
) states that both Sensor 1 and Sensor 2 have
failed
In the first two scenarios, the 4–20 mA signal is not disrupted and the status
available to the control system (via HART) specifies which sensor has failed.
2.7.3  Hot Backup configuration
The Hot Backup™
 feature configures the transmitter to automatically use Sensor
2 as the primary sensor if Sensor 1 fails. With Hot Backup enabled, the primary
variable (PV) must either be first good or average. See the Note for details on
using Hot Backup when the PV is set to Sensor Average.
Sensors 1 or 2 can be mapped as the secondary variable (SV), tertiary variable
(TV), or quaternary variable (QV). In the event of a primary variable (Sensor 1)
failure, the transmitter enters Hot Backup mode and Sensor 2 becomes the PV.
The 4–20 mA signal is not disrupted, and a status is available to the control
system through HART®
 that Sensor 1 has failed. An LCD display, if attached,
displays the failed sensor status.
While configured to Hot Backup, if Sensor 2 fails but Sensor 1 is still operating
properly, the transmitter continues to report the PV 4–20 mA analog output
signal, while a status is available to the control system through HART that Sensor
2 has failed.
Resetting Hot Backup
In Hot Backup™
 mode, if Sensor 1 does fail and Hot Backup is initiated, the
transmitter will not revert back to Sensor 1 to control the 4–20 mA analog output
until the Hot Backup mode is reset by re-enabling through HART®
, re-setting it
through the LOI or by briefly powering down the transmitter.

the necessary elements of the Hot Backup feature.

2.7.4  Sensor drift alert configuration
The sensor drift alert command allows the transmitter to set a warning flag
(through HART), or go into analog alarm when the temperature difference
between Sensor 1 and Sensor 2 exceeds a user-defined limit.
This feature is useful when measuring the same process temperature with two
sensors, ideally when using a dual-element sensor. When sensor drift alert mode
is enabled, the user sets the maximum allowable difference, in engineering units,
between sensor 1 and sensor 2. If this maximum difference is exceeded, a sensor
drift alert warning flag will be set.
Though it defaults to WARNING, when configuring the transmitter for sensor
drift alert, the user also has the option of specifying the analog output of the
transmitter go into ALARM when sensor drifting is detected.
Note
Using dual sensor configuration in the Rosemount 644 Transmitter, the
transmitter supports the configuration and simultaneous use of Hot Backup and
sensor drift alert. If one sensor fails, the transmitter switches output to use the
remaining good sensor. Should the difference between the two sensor readings
exceed the configured threshold, the AO will go to alarm indicating the sensor

2.8  Configure device outputs
2.8.1  Re-range the transmitter
Re-ranging the transmitter sets the measurement range to the limits of the
expected readings for a certain application. Setting the measurement range
to the limits of expected readings maximizes transmitter performance; the
transmitter is most accurate when operated within the expected temperature
range for the application.
The range of expected readings is defined by the Lower Range Value (LRV) and
Upper Range Value (URV). The transmitter range values can be reset as often as
necessary to reflect changing process conditions. For a complete listing of Range
and Sensor limits.
Note
The re-range functions should not be confused with the trim functions. Although
the re-range function matches a sensor input to a 4–20 mA output, as in
conventional calibration, it does not affect the transmitter’s interpretation of the
input.
Select from one of three methods to re-range the transmitter.

2.8.2  Damping
The damping function changes the response time of the transmitter to smooth
variations in output readings caused by rapid changes in input. Determine
the appropriate damping setting based on the necessary response time, signal
stability, and other requirements of the loop dynamics of the system. The default
damping value is 5.0 seconds and can be reset to any value between 1 and 32
seconds.
The value chosen for damping affects the response time of the transmitter. When
set to zero (disabled), the damping function is off and the transmitter output
reacts to changes in input as quickly as the intermittent sensor algorithm allows.
Increasing the damping value increases transmitter response time.
With damping enabled, if the temperature change is within 0.2 percent of
the sensor limits, the transmitter measures the change in input every 500
milliseconds (for a single sensor device) and outputs values according to the
following relationship:
Damped value  =   N − P x
2T − U
2T + U
+ P
P = previous damped value
N = new sensor value
T = damping time constant
U = update rate
At the value to which the damping time constant is set, the transmitter output
is at 63 percent of the input change and it continues to approach the input
according to the damping equation above.
For example, as illustrated in Figure 2-15, if the temperature undergoes a step
change—within 0.2 percent of the sensor limits—from 100 to 110 degrees, and
the damping is set to 5.0 seconds, the transmitter calculates and reports a new
reading every 500 milliseconds using the damping equation. At 5.0 seconds, the
transmitter outputs 106.3 degrees, or 63 percent of the input change, and the
output continues to approach the input curve according to the equation above.
Reference Manual Configuration
00809-0200-4728 January 2023

For information regarding the damping function when the input change is greater
than 0.2 percent of the sensor limits, refer to Intermittent sensor detection.
Figure 2-15: Change in Input vs. Change in Output with Damping Set to Five
Seconds
Damping can be applied to a number of parameters in the Rosemount 644
Transmitter. Variables that can be damped are:
• Primary Variable (PV)
• Sensor 1
• Sensor 2
• Differential temperature
• Average temperature
• First good temperature

2.8.3  Configure alarm and saturation levels
In normal operation, the transmitter will drive the output in response to
measurements between the lower to upper saturation points. If the temperature
goes outside the sensor limits, or if the output would be beyond the saturation
points, the output will be limited to the associated saturation point.
The transmitter automatically and continuously performs self-diagnostic routines.
If the self-diagnostic routines detect a failure, the transmitter drives the output to
configured alarm value based on the position of the alarm switch. The Alarm and
Saturation settings allow the alarm settings (Hi or Low) and saturation values to
be viewed and changed.
Failure mode alarm and saturation levels can be configured using a Field
Communicator, AMS Device Manager, and the LOI. The following limitations exist
for custom levels:
• The low alarm value must be less than the Low Saturation level.
• The high alarm value must be higher than the High Saturation level.
• Alarm and Saturation levels must be separated by at least 0.1 mA
The configuration tool will provide an error message if the configuration rule is
violated.
See table below for the common alarm and saturation levels.

2.9  Inputting device information
Access the transmitter information variables online using the Field Communicator
or other suitable communications device. The following is a list of transmitter
information variables, including device identifiers, factory-set configuration
variables, and other information.
2.9.1  Tag, Date, Descriptor, and Message
The Tag, Date, Descriptor, and Message are parameters that provide transmitter
identification in large installations.
The Tag variable is the easiest way to identify and distinguish between different
transmitters in multi-transmitter environments. It is used to label transmitters
electronically according to the requirements of the application. The defined Tag
is automatically displayed when a HART®
-based communicator establishes contact
with the transmitter at power-up. The Tag is up to eight characters and the Long
Tag (a parameter introduced with the HART 6 and 7 protocol) was extended to
32 characters long. Neither parameter has any impact on the primary variable
readings of the transmitter, it is only for information.
Configuration Reference Manual
January 2023 00809-0200-4728
40 Emerson.com/Rosemount
The Date is a user-defined variable that provides a place to save the date of the
last revision of configuration information. It has no impact on the operation of the
transmitter or the HART-based communicator.
The Descriptor variable provides a longer user-defined electronic label to assist
with more specific transmitter identification than is available with tag. The
Descriptor may be up to 16 characters long and has no impact on the operation of
the transmitter or the HART-based communicator.
The Message variable provides the most specific user-defined means for
identifying individual transmitters in multi-transmitter environments. It allows for
32 characters of information and is stored with the other configuration data.
The Message variable has no impact on the operation of the transmitter or the
HART-based communicator.

2.10.3  Intermittent sensor detection
The intermittent sensor detection feature (also known as the transient filter)
is designed to guard against erratic process temperature readings caused by
intermittent open sensor conditions. An intermittent sensor condition is an open
sensor condition that lasts less than one update. By default, the transmitter
is shipped with the intermittent sensor detection feature switched ON and the
threshold value set at 0.2 percent of sensor limits. The intermittent sensor detect
feature can be switched ON or OFF and the threshold value can be changed
to any value between 0 and 100 percent of the sensor limits with a Field
Communicator.
When the intermittent sensor detection feature is switched ON, the transmitter
can eliminate the output pulse caused by intermittent open sensor conditions.
Process temperature changes (T) within the threshold value will be tracked
normally by the transmitter’s output. A (T) greater than the threshold value will
activate the intermittent sensor algorithm. True open sensor conditions will cause
the transmitter to go into alarm.
The threshold value of the transmitter should be set at a level that allows the
normal range of process temperature fluctuations; too high and the algorithm will
not be able to filter out intermittent conditions; too low and the algorithm will be
activated unnecessarily. The default threshold value is 0.2 percent of the sensor
limits.
When the intermittent sensor detection feature is switched OFF, the transmitter
tracks all process temperature changes, even from an intermittent sensor. (The
transmitter behaves as though the threshold value had been set at 100 percent.)
The output delay due to the intermittent sensor algorithm will be eliminated.
Configure intermittent sensor detect using a Field
Communicator
The following steps indicate how to turn the intermittent sensor detect (or
transient filter) feature ON or OFF. When the transmitter is connected to a Field
Communicator, use the Fast Key sequence and choose ON (normal setting) or
OFF.
From the HOME screen, enter the Fast Key sequence.
Device Dashboard Fast Keys 2, 2, 7, 4, 2
The threshold value can be changed from the default value of 0.2 percent.
Turning the Intermittent Sensor Detect feature OFF or leaving it ON and
increasing the threshold value above the default does not affect the time needed
for the transmitter to output the correct alarm signal after detecting a true
open sensor condition. However, the transmitter may briefly output a false
temperature reading for up to one update in either direction up to the threshold
value (100 percent of sensor limits if Intermittent Sensor Detect is OFF). Unless
a rapid response rate is necessary, the suggested setting is ON with 0.2 percent
threshold.

3. Select Apply when complete.
2.10.4  Open sensor hold off
The open sensor hold off option, at the normal setting, enables the Rosemount
644 Transmitter to be more robust under heavy EMI conditions. This is
accomplished by the software having the transmitter perform additional
verification of the open sensor status prior to activating the transmitter alarm.
If the additional verification shows that the open sensor condition is not valid, the
transmitter will not go into alarm.
For users of the Rosemount 644 Transmitter that desire a more vigorous open
sensor detection, the open sensor hold off option can be changed to a fast setting
where the transmitter will report an open sensor condition without additional
verification of whether or not the open condition is valid.
Note
In high noise environments, normal mode is recommended.

2.11.3  Thermocouple degradation diagnostic
Thermocouple degradation diagnostic acts as a gauge of the general health of
the thermocouple and is indicative of any major changes in the status of the
thermocouple or the thermocouple loop. The transmitter monitors the resistance
of the thermocouple loop to detect drift conditions or wiring condition changes.
The transmitter uses a baseline and threshold Trigger value and reports the
suspected status of the thermocouple based off the difference between these
values. This feature is not intended to be a precise measurement of thermocouple
status, but is a general indicator of thermocouple and thermocouple loop health.
Thermocouple diagnostic must be Enabled as well as connected and configured
to read a thermocouple type sensor. Once the diagnostic has been activated, a
baseline resistance value is calculated. Then a Trigger threshold must be selected,
Configuration Reference Manual
January 2023 00809-0200-4728
46 Emerson.com/Rosemount
which can be two, three, or four times the baseline resistance, or the default
of 5000 ohms. If the thermocouple loop resistance reaches the Trigger Level, a
maintenance alert is generated.
 CAUTION
The thermocouple degradation diagnostic monitors the health of the entire
thermocouple loop, including wiring, terminations, junctions, and the sensor
itself. Therefore, it is imperative that the diagnostic baseline resistance be
measured with the sensor fully installed and wired in the process, and not on the
bench.
Note
The thermocouple resistance algorithm does not calculate resistance values while
the active calibrator mode is enabled.

2.12  Establishing multi-drop communication
Multi-dropping refers to the connection of several transmitters to a single
communications transmission line. Communication between the host and the
transmitters takes place digitally with the analog output of the transmitters
deactivated.
Many Rosemount transmitters can be multi-dropped. With the Field
Communications protocol, up to 15 transmitters can be connected on a single
twisted pair of wires or over leased phone lines.
A Field Communicator can test, configure, and format a multi-dropped
Transmitter in the same way as in a standard point-to-point installation. The
application of a multidrop installation requires consideration of the update rate
necessary from each transmitter, the combination of transmitter models, and
the length of the transmission line. Each transmitter is identified by a unique
address (1–15) and responds to the commands defined in the HART protocol. A
Field Communicator can test, configure, and format a multidropped transmitter
the same as in a standard point-to-point installation.
Note
Multi-drop is not suitable for safety-certified applications and installations.

Note
Rosemount 644 Transmitters are set to address 0 at the factory, allowing them to
operate in the standard point-to-point manner with a 4–20 mA output signal. To
activate multidrop communication, the transmitter address must be changed to a
number between 1 and 15. This change deactivates the 4–20 mA analog output,
sending it to 4 mA. The failure mode current also is disabled.
2.12.1  Changing a transmitter address
To activate multi-drop communication, the transmitter poll address must be
assigned a number from 1–15 for HART Revision 5, and 1–63 for HART Revision 7.
Each transmitter in a multi dropped loop must have a unique poll address.

2.13  Using the transmitter with the HART TriLoop
To prepare the transmitter with dual-sensor option for use with a Rosemount
333 HART®
 Tri-Loop, the transmitter must be configured to Burst Mode and
the process variable output order must be set. In Burst Mode, the transmitter
provides digital information for the four process variables to the HART Tri-Loop.
The HART Tri-Loop divides the signal into separate 4–20 mA loops for up to three
of the following choices:
• Primary Variable (PV)
• Secondary Variable (SV)
• Tertiary Variable (TV)
• Quaternary Variable (QV)
When using the transmitter with dual-sensor option in conjunction with the
HART Tri-Loop, consider the configuration of the differential, average, first good
temperatures, Sensor Drift Alert, and Hot Backup features (if applicable).
Note
The procedures are to be used when the sensors and transmitters are connected,
powered, and functioning properly. Also, Field Communicator must be connected
and communicating to the transmitter control loop. For communicator usage
instructions, see Verify configuration using the Field Communicator.

1. Right click on the device and select Configure.
2. In the left navigation window select Manual Setup.
3. On the HART tab find the Burst Mode Configuration group box and fill in the
necessary content.
4. Select Apply when complete.
2.13.2  Set process variable output order
To set the process variable output order, follow the steps in one of the methods
outlined in Mapping the HART variables.
Note
Take careful note of the process variable output order. The HART®
 Tri-Loop must
be configured to read the variables in the same order.
Special considerations
To initiate operation between a transmitter with dual-sensor option and the
HART®
 Tri-Loop, consider the configuration of both the differential, average and
first good temperatures, sensor drift alert, and Hot Backup features (if applicable).
Differential temperature measurement
To enable the differential temperature measurement feature of a dual-sensor
operating in conjunction with the HART®
 Tri-Loop, adjust the range end points of
the corresponding channel on the HART Tri-Loop to include zero. For example,
if the secondary variable is to report the differential temperature, configure
the transmitter accordingly (see Mapping the HART variables) and adjust the
corresponding channel of the HART Tri-Loop so one range end point is negative
and the other is positive.
Configuration Reference Manual
January 2023 00809-0200-4728
52 Emerson.com/Rosemount
Hot Backup
To enable the Hot Backup feature of a transmitter with dual-sensor option
operating in conjunction with the HART Tri-Loop, ensure that the output units of
the sensors are the same as the units of the HART Tri-Loop. Use any combination
of RTDs or thermocouples as long as the units of both match the units of the
HART Tri-Loop.
Using the Tri-Loop to detect sensor drift alert
The dual-sensor transmitter sets a failure flag (through HART) whenever a sensor
failure occurs. If an analog warning is required, the HART Tri-Loop can be
configured to produce an analog signal that can be interpreted by the control
system as a sensor failure.
Use these steps to set up the HART Tri-Loop to transmit sensor failure alerts.
Procedure
1. Configure the dual-sensor transmitter variable map as shown:
Variable Mapping
PV Sensor 1 or sensor average
SV Sensor 2
TV Differential temperature
QV As desired
2. Configure Channel 1 of the HART Tri-Loop as TV (differential temperature).
If either sensor should fail, the differential temperature output will be
+9999 or –9999 (high or low saturation), depending on the position of the
Failure Mode Switch (see Setting the alarm switch).
3. Select temperature units for Channel 1 that match the differential
temperature units of the transmitter.
4. Specify a range for the TV such as -148 to 212 °F (-100 to 100 °C). If the
range is large, then a sensor drift of a few degrees will represent only a
small percent of range. If Sensor 1 or Sensor 2 fails, the TV will be +9999
(high saturation) or –9999 (low saturation). In this example, zero is the
midpoint of the TV range. If a ΔT of zero is set as the lower range limit
(4 mA), then the output could saturate low if the reading from Sensor 2
exceeds the reading from Sensor 1. By placing a zero in the middle of the
range, the output will normally stay near 12 mA, and the problem will be
avoided.
5. Configure the DCS so that TV << –148 °F (–100 °C) or TV >> 212 °F (100 °C)
indicates a sensor failure and, for example, TV ≤ 26.6 °F (–3 °C) or TV ≥ 37.4
°F (3 °C) indicates a drift alert. See Figure 2-26.

3  Hardware Installation
Note
Each transmitter is marked with a tag indicating the approvals. Install the
transmitter according to all applicable installation codes, and approval and
installation drawings (see Product Data Sheet). Verify the operating atmosphere
of the transmitter is consistent with the hazardous location certifications. Once a
device labeled with multiple approval types is installed, it should not be reinstalled
using any of the other labeled approval types. To ensure this, the approval label
should be permanently marked to distinguish the approval type(s) used.
3.1  Overview
The information in this section covers installation considerations for the
Rosemount 644 Temperature Transmitter with HART®
 Protocol. A Quick Start
Guide is shipped with every transmitter to describe recommended mounting and
wiring procedures for initial installation. Dimensional drawings for transmitter
mounting configurations are included in the Product Data Sheet.
3.2  Safety messages
Instructions and procedures in this section may require special precautions to
ensure the safety of the personnel performing the operations. Refer to the
following safety messages before performing an operation preceded by this
symbol.
 WARNING
Follow instruction
Failure to follow these installation guidelines could result in death or serious
injury.
Ensure only qualified personnel perform the installation.
Explosion
Explosions could result in death or serious injury.

 WARNING
Process leaks
Process leaks could result in death or serious injury.
Do not remove the thermowell while in operation.
Install and tighten thermowells and sensors before applying pressure.
Electric shock
Electrical shock could cause death or serious injury.
Use extreme caution when making contact with the leads and terminals.
Physical access
Unauthorized personnel may potentially cause significant damage to and/or
misconfiguration of end users’ equipment. This could be intentional or
unintentional and needs to be protected against.
Physical security is an important part of any security program and fundamental to
protecting your system. Restrict physical access by unauthorized personnel to
protect end users’ assets. This is true for all systems used within the facility.
3.3  Considerations
3.3.1  General
Electrical temperature sensors such as RTDs and thermocouples produce lowlevel signals proportional to their sensed temperature. The transmitter converts
the low-level sensor signal to a standard 4–20 mA dc or digital HART®
 signal
that is relatively insensitive to lead length and electrical noise. This signal is then
transmitted to the control room via two wires.
3.3.2  Commissioning
The transmitter can be commissioned before or after installation. It may be useful
to commission it on the bench, before installation, to ensure proper operation
and to become familiar with its functionality. Ensure the instruments in the loop
are installed in accordance with intrinsically safe, or non-incendive field wiring
practices.
3.3.3  Installation
Measurement accuracy depends upon proper installation of the transmitter.
Mount the transmitter close to the process and use minimum wiring to achieve
best accuracy. Keep in mind the need for easy access, personnel safety, practical
field calibration, and a suitable transmitter environment. Install the transmitter to
minimize vibration, shock, and temperature fluctuation.

Mount Transmitter to a DIN rail or assembling a new Rosemount 644 Head Mount
to an existing threaded sensor connection head (former option code L1).
3.3.5  Electrical
Proper electrical installation is necessary to prevent errors due to sensor lead
resistance and electrical noise. For best results, shielded cable should be used in
electrically noisy environments.
Make wiring connections through the cable entry in the side of the housing.
Provide adequate clearance for cover removal.
3.3.6  Environmental
The transmitter electronics module is permanently sealed within a plastic
enclosure, resisting moisture and corrosive damage. Verify that the operating
atmosphere of the transmitter is consistent with the appropriate hazardous
locations certifications.
Temperature effects
The transmitter will operate within specifications for ambient temperatures
between –40 and 185 °F (–40 °C and 85 °C). Heat from the process is transferred
from the thermowell to the transmitter housing. If the expected process
temperature is near or beyond specification limits, consider the use of additional
thermowell lagging, an extension nipple, or a remote mounting configuration to
isolate the transmitter from the process.
Figure 3-1 provides an example of the relationship between transmitter housing
temperature rise and extension length.

Example
The maximum permissible housing temperature rise (T) can be calculated
by subtracting the maximum ambient temperature (A) from the transmitter’s
ambient temperature specification limit (S). For instance, if A = 40 °C.
T = S - A T = 85 °C – 40 °C T = 45 °C
For a process temperature of 540 °C (1004 °F), an extension length of 3.6-in.
(91.4 mm) yields a housing temperature rise (R) of 22 °C (72 °F), providing a
safety margin of 23 °C (73 °F). A 6.0-in. (152.4 mm) extension length (R = 10
°C [50 °F]) offers a higher safety margin (35 °C [95 °F]) and reduces temperatureeffect errors but would probably require extra transmitter support. Gauge the
requirements for individual applications along this scale. If a thermowell with
lagging is used, the extension length may be reduced by the length of the
lagging.

3.4.4  Multichannel installations
In a HART®
 installation, several transmitters can be connected to a single master
power supply, as shown in Figure 3-6. In this case, the system may be grounded
only at the negative power supply terminal. In multichannel installations where
several transmitters depend on one power supply and the loss of all transmitters
would cause operational problems, consider an uninterrupted power supply or a
back-up battery. The diodes shown in Figure 3-6 prevent unwanted charging or
discharging of the back-up battery.

 WARNING
Physical access
Unauthorized personnel may potentially cause significant damage to and/or
misconfiguration of end users’ equipment. This could be intentional or
unintentional and needs to be protected against.
Physical security is an important part of any security program and fundamental to
protecting your system. Restrict physical access by unauthorized personnel to
protect end users’ assets. This is true for all systems used within the facility.
4.3  Wiring and powering the transmitter
All power to the transmitter is supplied over the signal wiring. Use ordinary
copper wire of sufficient size to ensure the voltage across the transmitter power
terminals does not drop below 12.0 Vdc.
If the sensor is installed in a high-voltage environment and a fault condition or
installation error occurs, the sensor leads and transmitter terminals could carry
lethal voltages. Use extreme caution when making contact with the leads and
terminals.
Note
Do not apply high voltage (e.g., ac line voltage) to the transmitter terminals.
Abnormally high voltage can damage the unit. (Sensor and transmitter power
terminals are rated to 42.4 Vdc. A constant 42.4 volts across the sensor terminals
may damage the unit.)
For multichannel HART installations, the transmitters will accept inputs from a
variety of RTD and thermocouple types. Refer to Figure 2-7 when making sensor
connections.
The sensor wiring diagram is located on the device’s top label below the terminal
screws. See Figure 4-1 and Sensor wiring for where to find and how to correctly
wire all sensor types to the transmitter.

4.3.1  Sensor connections
The transmitter is compatible with a number of RTD and thermocouple sensor
types. Sensor wiring shows the correct input connections to the sensor terminals
on the transmitter. To ensure a proper sensor connection, anchor the sensor lead
wires into the appropriate captive terminals and tighten the screws.
Sensor wiring
Emerson provides a 4-wire sensors for all single element RTDs.
You can use these RTDs in 3-wire configurations by leaving the unneeded leads
disconnected and insulated with electrical tape.

Thermocouple or millivolt inputs
The thermocouple can be connected directly to the transmitter. Use appropriate
thermocouple extension wire if mounting the transmitter remotely from the
sensor. Make millivolt inputs connections with copper wire. Use shielding for long
runs of wire.
RTD or Ohm inputs
The transmitters will accept a variety of RTD configurations, including 2-, 3- or
4-wire. If the transmitter is mounted remotely from a 3- or 4-wire RTD, it will
operate within specifications, without recalibration, for lead wire resistances of
up to 60 ohms per lead (equivalent to 6,000 feet of 20 AWG wire). In this case,
the leads between the RTD and transmitter should be shielded. If using only two
leads, both RTD leads are in series with the sensor element, so significant errors
can occur if the lead lengths exceed three feet of 20 AWG wire (approximately
0.05 °C/ft). For longer runs, attach a third or fourth lead as described above.
Sensor lead wire resistance effect– RTD input
When using a 4-wire RTD, the effect of lead resistance is eliminated and has no
impact on accuracy. However, a 3-wire sensor will not fully cancel lead resistance
error because it cannot compensate for imbalances in resistance between the
lead wires. Using the same type of wire on all three lead wires will make a 3-wire
RTD installation as accurate as possible. A 2-wire sensor will produce the largest
error because it directly adds the lead wire resistance to the sensor resistance.
For 2- and 3-wire RTDs, an additional lead wire resistance error is induced with
ambient temperature variations. The table and the examples shown below help
quantify these errors.
Note
For HART transmitters, the use of two grounded thermocouples with a dual
option transmitter is not recommended. For applications in which the use of
two thermocouples is desired, connect either two ungrounded thermocouples,
one grounded and one ungrounded thermocouple, or one dual element
thermocouple.

Load limitation
The power required across the transmitter power terminals is 12 to 42.4 Vdc (the
power terminals are rated to 42.4 Vdc). To prevent damaging the transmitter,
do not allow terminal voltage to drop below 12.0 Vdc when changing the
configuration parameters.
4.3.3  Ground the transmitter
Sensor shielding
The currents in the leads induced by electromagnetic interference can be reduced
by shielding. Shielding carries the current to ground and away from the leads
and electronics. If the ends of the shields are adequately grounded, only a
small amount of current will actually enter the transmitter. If the ends of the
shield are left ungrounded, voltage is created between the shield and the
transmitter housing and also between the shield and earth at the element end.
The transmitter may not be able to compensate for this voltage, causing it to lose
communication and/or go into alarm. Instead of the shield carrying the currents
away from the transmitter, the currents will now flow through the sensor leads
into the transmitter circuitry where it will interfere with the circuit operation.
Shielding recommendations
The following are recommended practices from API Standard 552 (Transmission
Standard) section 20.7, and from field and laboratory testing. If more than one
recommendation is given for a sensor type, start with the first technique shown
or the technique that is recommended for the facility by its installation drawings.
If the technique does not eliminate the transmitter alarms, try another technique.
If all of the techniques do not eliminate or prevent the transmitter alarms because
of high EMI, contact an Emerson representative.
To ensure proper grounding, it is important that the instrument cable shield be:
• Trimmed close and insulated from touching the transmitter housing
• Connected to the next shield if cable is routed through a junction box
• Connected to a good earth ground at the power supply end
Ungrounded thermocouple, mV, and RTD/Ohm inputs
Each process installation has different requirements for grounding. Use the
grounding options recommended by the facility for the specific sensor type, or
begin with grounding option 1 (the most common).
Ground the transmitter: option 1
Procedure
1. Connect sensor wiring shield to the transmitter housing.
2. Ensure the sensor shield is electrically isolated from surrounding fixtures
that may be grounded.
3. Ground signal wiring shield at the power supply end.

4.3.4  Wiring with a Rosemount 333 HART Tri-Loop
(HART/4–20 mA only)
Use the dual-sensor option transmitter that is operating with two sensors
in conjunction with a Rosemount 333 HART®
 Tri-Loop HART-to-Analog Signal
Converter to acquire an independent 4–20 mA analog output signal for each
sensor input. The transmitter can be configured to output four of the six following
digital process variables:
• Sensor 1
• Sensor 2
• Differential temperature
• Average temperature
• First good temperature
• Transmitter terminal temperature
The HART Tri-Loop reads the digital signal and outputs any or all of these
variables into as many as three separate 4–20 mA analog channels. Refer
to Figure 2-7 for basic installation information. Refer to the Rosemount 333
HART Tri-Loop HART-to-Analog Signal Converter Reference Manual for complete
installation information.
Power supply
An external power supply is required to operate the transmitter and is not
included. The input voltage range of the transmitter is 12–42.4 Vdc. This is the
power required across the transmitter power terminals. The power terminals
are rated to 42.4 Vdc. With 250 ohms of resistance in the loop, the transmitter
requires a minimum of 18.1 Vdc for communication.
The power supplied to the transmitter is determined by the total loop resistance
and should not drop below the lift-off voltage. The lift-off voltage is the minimum
supply voltage required for any given total loop resistance. If the power drops
below the lift-off voltage while the transmitter is being configured, the transmitter
may output incorrect information.
The DC power supply should provide power with less than two percent ripple. The
total resistance load is the sum of the resistance of the signal leads and the load
resistance of any controller, indicator, or related piece of equipment in the loop.
Note that the resistance of intrinsic safety barriers, if used, must be included.
Note
Permanent damage to the transmitter could result if the voltage drops below 12.0
Vdc at the power terminals, when changing transmitter configuration parameters.

5.3  Calibration overview
Calibrating the transmitter increases the measurement precision by allowing
corrections to be made to the factory-stored characterization curve by digitally
altering the transmitter’s interpretation of the sensor input.
To understand calibration, it is necessary to understand that smart transmitters
operate differently from analog transmitters. An important difference is that
smart transmitters are factory-characterized, meaning that they are shipped
with a standard sensor curve stored in the transmitter firmware. In operation,
the transmitter uses this information to produce a process variable output, in
engineering units, dependent on the sensor input.
Calibration of the transmitter may include the following procedures:
• Sensor Input Trim: digitally alter the transmitter’s interpretation of the input
signal.
• Transmitter-Sensor Matching: generates a special custom curve to match that
specific sensor curve, as derived from the Callendar-Van Dusen constants.
• Output Trim: calibrates the transmitter to a 4–20 mA reference scale.
• Scaled Output Trim: calibrates the transmitter to a user-selectable reference
scale.
5.3.1  Trimming
The trim functions should not be confused with the rerange functions. Although
the re-range command matches a sensor input to a 4–20 mA output—as in
conventional calibration—it does not affect the transmitter’s interpretation of the
input.
One or more of the trim functions may be used when calibrating. The trim
functions are as follows:
• Sensor input trim
• Transmitter-sensor matching
• Output trim
• Output scaled trim

5.4  Sensor input trim
The sensor trim command allows for alteration of the transmitter’s interpretation
of the input signal. The sensor trim command trims, in engineering (°F, °C, °R, K)
or raw (ohms, mV) units, the combined sensor and transmitter system to a site
standard using a known temperature source. Sensor trim is suitable for validation
procedures or for applications that require profiling the sensor and transmitter
together.
Perform a sensor trim if the transmitter’s digital value for the primary variable
does not match the plant’s standard calibration equipment. The sensor trim
function calibrates the sensor to the transmitter in temperature units or raw
units. Unless the site-standard input source is NIST-traceable, the trim functions
will not maintain the NIST-traceability of your system.

5.4.4  Active calibrator and EMF compensation
The transmitter operates with a pulsating sensor current to allow EMF
compensation and detection of open sensor conditions. Because some calibration
equipment requires a steady sensor current to function properly, the “Active
Calibrator Mode” feature should be used when an Active Calibrator is connected.
Enabling this mode temporarily sets the transmitter to provide steady sensor
current unless two sensor inputs are configured.
Disable this mode before putting the transmitter back into the process to set the
transmitter back to pulsating current. “Active Calibrator Mode” is volatile and will
automatically be disabled when a master reset is performed (through HART) or
when the power is cycled.
Operation and Maintenance Reference Manual
January 2023 00809-0200-4728
90 Emerson.com/Rosemount
EMF compensation allows the transmitter to provide sensor measurements
that are unaffected by unwanted voltages, typically due to thermal EMFs in
the equipment connected to the transmitter, or by some types of calibration
equipment. If this equipment also requires steady sensor current, the transmitter
must be set to “Active Calibrator Mode.” However, the steady current does not
allow the transmitter to perform EMF compensation and as a result, a difference
in readings between the Active Calibrator and actual sensor may exist.
If a reading difference is experienced and is greater than the plant’s accuracy
specification allows, perform a sensor trim with “Active Calibrator Mode” disabled.
In this case, an active calibrator capable of tolerating pulsating sensor current
must be used or the actual sensors must be connected to the transmitter. When
the Field Communicator, AMS Device Manager, or the LOI asks if an Active
Calibrator is being used when the sensor trim routine is entered, select No to
leave the “Active Calibrator Mode” disabled.
5.5  Trim the analog output
5.5.1  Analog output trim or scaled analog output trim
Perform an output trim or a scaled output trim if the digital value for the primary
variable matches the plant’s standards but the transmitter’s analog output does
not match the reading on the output device. The output trim function calibrates
the transmitter to a 4–20 mA reference scale; the scaled output trim function
calibrates to a user-selectable reference scale. To determine the need for an
output trim or a scaled output trim, perform a loop test (Perform a loop test).

Use Transmitter-Sensor Matching to enhance the temperature measurement
accuracy of the system and if you have a sensor with Callendar-Van Dusen
constants. When ordered from Emerson, sensors with Callendar-Van Dusen
constants are NIST-traceable.
The transmitter accepts Callendar-Van Dusen constants from a calibrated RTD
schedule and generates a special custom curve to match that specific sensor
Resistance vs. Temperature performance. Figure 5-6.

7  Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS)
Certification
7.1  SIS certification
The safety-critical output of the Rosemount 644P Temperature Transmitter is
provided through a 2-wire, 4–20 mA signal representing temperature. The
transmitter can be equipped with or without a display. The Rosemount 644P
Safety Certified Safety Transmitter is certified to: Low demand; Type B.
• SIL 2 for random integrity at HFT=0
• SIL 3 for random integrity at HFT=1
• SIL 3 for systematic integrity
7.2  Safety certified identification
All Rosemount 644 HART Head Mount and Field Mount Transmitters must be
identified as safety certified before installing into a SIS.
To identify a safety-certified transmitter, ensure the device satisfies the
requirements below:
Procedure
1. Verify the transmitter was ordered with output option code “A” and option
code “QT”. This signifies that it is a 4–20 mA/HART safety certified device.
a) For example: MODEL 644HA..........QT.....
2. See a Yellow Tag affixed to the top of the transmitter face or a Yellow Tag
affixed to the outside of the enclosure if pre-assembled.
3. Check the Namur Software Revision located on the adhesive transmitter
tag. “SW _._._”.
If the Device label software revision is 1.1.1 or higher, the device is safety
certified.
7.3  Installation
Installations are to be performed by qualified personnel. No special installation
is required in addition to the standard installation practices outlined in this
document. Always ensure a proper seal by installing the electronics housing
cover(s) so that metal contacts metal.
The loop should be designed so the terminal voltage does not drop below 12 Vdc
when the transmitter output is 24.5 mA.
Reference Manual Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS) Certification
00809-0200-4728 January 2023
Emerson.com/Rosemount 109
Environmental limits are available in the Rosemount 644 Temperature
Transmitter product page.
7.4  Configuration
Use any HART-capable configuration tool or the optional Local Operator Interface
(LOI) to communicate with and verify the initial configuration or any configuration
changes made to the transmitter prior to operating in Safety Mode. All
configuration methods outlined in Configuration are the same for the safetycertified transmitter with any differences noted.
Software lock must be used in order to prevent unwanted changes to the
transmitter configuration.
Note
Transmitter output is not safety-rated during the following: Configuration
changes, Multidrop operation, Simulation, Active calibrator mode, and loop tests.
Alternative means should be used to ensure process safety during transmitter
configuration and maintenance activities.
7.4.1  Damping
User-adjustable damping affects the transmitter’s ability to respond to changes in
the applied process. The damping value + response time should not exceed the
loop requirements.
If using a thermowell assembly, ensure to also take into account the added
response time due to thermowell material.
7.4.2  Alarm and saturation levels
DCS or safety logic solver should be configured to match transmitter
configuration. Figure 7-1 identifies the three alarm levels available and their
operations values.

Procedure
1. Bypass the safety PLC or take other appropriate action to avoid a false trip.
2. Send a HART command to the transmitter to go to high alarm current
output and verify that the analog current reaches that value. This tests for
compliance voltage problems such as low loop power supply voltage or
increased wiring resistance. This also tests for other possible failures.
3. Send a HART command to the transmitter to go to the low alarm current
output and verify that the analog current reaches that value. This tests for
possible quiescent current related failures.
4. Use the HART communicator to view detailed device status to ensure no
alarms or warnings are present in the transmitter.
5. Perform reasonability check on the sensor value(s) versus an independent
estimate (i.e. from direct monitoring of BPCS value) to show current reading
is good.
6. Restore the loop to full operation.
7. Remove the bypass from the safety PLC or otherwise restore to normal
operation.
7.5.3  Comprehensive proof test 2
The comprehensive proof test 2 consists of performing the same steps as the
partial proof test but with a two-point calibration of the temperature sensor
in place of the reasonability check. Reference the FMEDA report for percent of
possible DU failures in the device.
Required tools: Field Communicator, temperature calibration equipment
Procedure
1. Bypass the safety PLC or take other appropriate action to avoid a false trip.
2. Perform partial proof test 1.
3. Verify the measurement for two temperature points for Sensor 1. Verify the
measurement for two temperature points for Sensor 2, if second sensor is
present.
4. Perform reasonability check of the housing temperature.
5. Restore the loop to full operation.
6. Remove the bypass from the safety PLC or otherwise restore to normal
operation.
7.5.4  Comprehensive proof test 3

C  Local Operator Interface (LOI)
• The LOI requires option code M4 to be ordered.
• To activate the LOI, push either configuration button. Configuration buttons
are located on the LCD display (remove the housing cover to access the
interface. See Table C-1 for configuration button functionality and Figure C-1
for configuration button location).
When using the LOI for configuration, several features require multiple screens
for a successful configuration. Data entered will be saved on a screen-by-screen
basis; the LOI will indicate this by flashing SAVED on the LCD display each time.
Note
Entering into the LOI menu effectively disables the ability to write to the device
by any other host or configuration tool. Ensure this is communicated to necessary
personnel before using the LOI for device configuration.

LOI password
An LOI password can be entered and enabled to prevent review and modification
of device configuration via the LOI. This does not prevent configuration from
HART®
 or through the control system. The LOI password is a four-digit code that
is to be set by the user. If the password is lost or forgotten the master password
is “9307”. The LOI password can be configured and enabled/disabled by HART
communication via a Field Communicator, AMS Device Manager, or the LOI.
C.1  Number entry
Floating-point numbers can be entered with the LOI. All eight number locations
on the top line can be used for number entry. Refer to Table 2-2 for LOI button
operation. Below is a floating-point number entry example for changing a value of
“-0000022” to “000011.2”
Table C-2: LOI Number Entry
Step Instruction Current position
(indicated by underline)
1 When the number entry begins, the left
most position is the selected position.
In this example, the negative symbol,
“-“, will be flashing on the screen.
-0000022
2 Press the scroll button until the “0” is
blinking on the screen in the selected
position.
00000022
3 Press the enter button to select the “0”
as an entry. The second digit from the
left will be blinking.
00000022
4 Press the enter button to select “0” for
second digit. The third digit from the
left will be blinking.
00000022
5 Press the enter button to select “0” for
the third digit. The fourth digit from the
left will now be blinking.
00000022
6 Press the enter button to select “0” for
the fourth digit. The fifth digit from the
left will now be blinking.
00000022
7 Press scroll to navigate through the
numbers until the “1” is on the screen.
00001022
8 Press the enter button to select the “1”
for the fifth digit. The sixth digit from
the left will now be blinking.
00001022
9 Press scroll to navigate through the
numbers until the “1”, is on the screen.
00001122
10 Press the enter button to select the “1”
for the sixth digit. The seventh digit
from the left will now be blinking.

11 Press scroll to navigate through the
numbers until the decimal, “.”, is on the
screen.
000011.2
12 Press the enter button to select the
decimal, “.”, for the seventh digit. After
pressing enter, all digits to the right
of the decimal will now be zero. The
eighth digit from the left will now be
blinking.
000011.0
13 Press the scroll button to navigate
through the numbers until the “2”, is on
the screen.
000011.2
14 Press the enter button to select the “2”
for the eighth digit. The number entry
will be complete and a “SAVE” screen
will be shown.
000011.2
Usage notes:
• It is possible to move backwards in the number by scrolling to the left and
pressing enter. The left arrow appears as such in the LOI: ;
• The negative symbol is only allowed in the left most position.
• The Over score character “¯ “is used in the LOI to enter a blank space for Tag
entry.
C.2  Text entry
Text can be entered with the LOI. Depending on the edited item, up to eight
locations on the top line can be used for text entry. Text entry follows the same
rules as the number entry rules in Number entry, except the following characters
are available in all locations: A-Z, 0-9, -, /, space.
C.2.1  Scrolling
When it is desired to move more quickly through the list of menu choices or alpha
numeric characters without individual button presses, a faster scrolling technique
is available. Scrolling functionality allows the user to walk through any menu in
forward or reverse order, enter text or digits easily and quickly.
Menu scrolling
Simply hold down the left button after it brings you to the next menu item, each
of the proceeding menus will be shown one after another while the button is
pressed down.

C.3  Timeout
The LOI in standard operation will Time Out and return to the home screen after
15 minutes of inactivity. To re-enter into the LOI menu, press either button.
C.4  Saving and canceling
The Save and Cancel functionality implemented at the end of a series of steps
allows the user to save the change or exit the function without saving any of the
changes. The way these functions are shown should always look as follows:
Saving
Whether you’re choosing a setting from a list of choices or entering digits or
text the first screen shall show “SAVE?” to ask the user if they want to save
the information just entered. You can select the cancel function (choose NO) or
the save function (choose YES). After the save function is selected, “SAVED” shall
appear on the screen.
