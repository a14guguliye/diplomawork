Ordering spare parts
When ordering spare parts, the valve size,
style and assembly number and/or serial
number should be given together with set
pressure, part name and reference number
from page 4. Spare parts may be ordered
from any Emerson regional sales office or
authorized representative.
All personnel working with Emerson products
should be trained adequately and thoroughly
familiar with the contents of the appropriate
instruction manual(s).
Emerson cannot evaluate all conditions in
which the products may be used.
However, Emerson offers the following general
safety suggestions:
• Never subject valves to sharp impact loads.
Rough handling (striking, bumping, dropping,
etc.) may alter the pressure setting, deform
valve parts and affect seat tightness and
valve performance adversely. Striking a
valve which is under pressure can cause
premature actuation.
These precautionary statements are by no
means exhaustive.
Emerson cannot be expected to know, evaluate
and advise customers of all the possible
applications and operating conditions for
its products or of the possible hazardous
consequences which may result from the
misapplication or misuse of such products.
Consequently, the improper handling,
storage, installation, use or maintenance
of any Emerson product by a non Emerson
employee may void any Emerson guarantees or
warranties with respect to such product.
• When moving a valve, never use the lifting
lever to lift the valve.
• Always lower the system pressure to the
pressure level specified in the instruction
before making any adjustment to the valve.
Furthermore, always install a proper test rod
to gag an installed valve before making any
ring adjustments on the valve.
• Ear and eye protection should be used when
working on a valve which has pressure.
• Never stand in front of the discharge
outlet of a pressure relief valve which is
under pressure.
• Always stand to the side of and at a safe
distance from the valve discharge and
use extreme care when observing a valve
for leakage.
The above precautions and suggestions are
by no means exhaustive and the user should
always approach and use any pressure relief
valve with great care.

INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE INSTRUCTIONS
2 STORAGE AND HANDLING
Valves are often on hand at the job site months
before they are installed. Unless stored
properly and protected, valve performance may
be affected adversely.
Rough handling and dirt may damage or
cause misalignment of the valve parts. It is
recommended that the valves be left in their
original shipping containers and that they be
stored in a warehouse or at a minimum on a
dry surface with a protective covering until they
are used.
Care should be exercised to ensure the
elastomer parts like diaphragm, soft seat
and O-Ring etc., are not damaged during
shipping and handling. In the case of large size
elastomer parts, provisions should be made to
not fold, crease or bend the material.
Unless otherwise specified, elastomer parts
can be only used until their Maximum Shelf
Life. The parts shall be scrapped past their
Maximum Shelf Life.
3 INSTALLATION
3.1 Care in handling
Pressure relief valves must be handled
carefully and never subjected to sharp
impact loads. They should not be struck,
bumped or dropped. Rough handling may
alter the pressure setting, deform valve
parts and affect seat tightness and valve
performance adversely.
When it is necessary to use a hoist, the chain
or sling should be placed around the valve body
and bonnet in a manner that will ensure that
the valve is in a vertical position to facilitate
installation. The valve should never be lifted or
handled using the lifting lever inlet and outlet
protectors should remain in place until the
valve is ready to be installed on the system.
1 INTRODUCTION
Crosby Style JOS-E, JBS-E, JBSBP-E, JLT-E
and JDS-E Pressure Relief Valves have been
selected for installation because of their
performance features, reliability and ease
of maintenance.
Adherence to the installation and maintenance
procedures specified herein will provide the
utmost in safety, a minimum of maintenance,
and a long service life. Crosby Style JOS-E,
JBS-E, JBSBP-E, JDS-E and JLT-E Valves
are manufactured in accordance with the
requirements of Section VIII ASME Boiler and
Pressure Vessel Code and Section XIII Rules for
Overpressure Protection.
Style JOS-E is a conventional closed bonnet
valve. Style JBS-E has a balanced bellows
for minimizing the effect of back pressure.
Style JBSBP-E are balanced bellows valves
with a supplementary back pressure balancing
piston with optional wired or wireless bellows
leak detection monitoring options.
Style JDS-E utilizes a balanced diaphragm
technology eliminating the need for bellows
providing improved performance.
Style JLT-E is a high performance valve
designed specifically for liquid service. The
JLT-E features a contoured liquid trim in a
standard JOS-E, JBS-E and/or JDS-E envelope.
3.3 Inlet piping
Pressure relief valves should be mounted
vertically in an upright position either directly
on a nozzle from the pressure vessel or on a
short connecting fitting that provides direct and
unobstructed flow between the vessel and the
valve. Installing a pressure relief valve in other
than this recommended position might affect
its operation adversely. Where rounded or
beveled approaches cannot be provided ahead
of the valve it is recommended that one size
larger nozzle or fitting be used. A valve should
never be installed on a fitting having a smaller
inside diameter than the inlet connection of
the valve.
Inlet piping (nozzles) must be designed to
withstand the total resultant forces due
to the valve discharging at the maximum
accumulated pressure and the expected piping
loads. The magnitudes of the bending moment
exerted on the inlet piping will depend on the
configuration and method of supporting the
outlet piping.
Many valves are damaged when first placed
in service because of failure to clean the
connections properly when installed. Both
the valve inlet and the vessel and/or line on
which the valve is mounted must be cleaned
thoroughly of all foreign material. The inlet
connection bolts or studs should be drawn
down evenly to avoid straining the valve body
with possible distortion of the nozzle flange
or base.
3.2 Inspection
Pressure relief valves should be inspected
visually before they are installed to ensure that
no damage has occurred during shipment or
while in storage.
All protective material, sealing plugs and any
extraneous material inside the valve body or
nozzle must be removed.
The valve nameplate and other identifying tags
should be checked to ensure that the particular
valve is being installed at the location for which
it was intended.
The valve seals protecting the spring setting
and ring adjustments should be intact. If seals
are not intact, the valve should be inspected,
tested and seals installed properly before use.

CROSBY STYLE JOS-E, JBS-E, JBSBP-E, JDS-E, JLTJBS-E, JLTJBSBP-E, JLTJOS-E, JLTJDS-E VALVES
INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE INSTRUCTIONS
3.4 Outlet piping
Outlet piping should be simple and direct.
Where possible, for non-hazardous fluids, a
short discharge pipe or vertical riser connected
through a long radius elbow venting directly to
atmosphere is recommended. Such discharge
piping should be at least the same size as the
valve outlet.
All discharge piping should be run as direct as
is practicable to the point of final release for
disposal. Valve effluent must discharge to a
safe disposal area.
Where discharge piping is long, due
consideration shall be given to the use of long
radius elbows, and the reduction of excessive
line strains through the use of expansion joints
and proper means of support to minimize
line sway and vibration under operating
conditions. Adequate drainage is required
to prevent corrosive media from collecting
in the discharge side of the pressure relief
valve. When required, low point drains shall be
provided in the discharge pipe. Particular care
must be observed to ensure that the drains
are directed or piped to a safe disposal area.
In installations where the pressure relief valve
discharges into a closed system, care must be
taken to ensure that built up and superimposed
back pressure has been calculated properly,
specified and accounted for when sizing and
selecting the valve.
Where built up back pressure is expected to
exceed 10% of set pressure or if superimposed
back pressure is variable, a bellows valve or a
diaphragm valve is required.
4 HYDROSTATIC PRESSURE TESTS
4.1 Hydrostatic test of vessel or system
When a pressure vessel or system is to be
hydrostatically tested, it is recommended
that the pressure relief valve be removed
and a blank flange be installed in its place.
This practice precludes the possibility of
any damage to the pressure relief valve.
Bent spindles and damaged valve seats are
problems that can be caused by improper
hydrostatic test procedures.
Blank flanges must be removed and the
pressure relief valve reinstalled before the
vessel is placed in service.
When the hydrostatic test must be performed
with the valve in place, a test gag may be used.
Crosby Style JOS-E/JBS-E/JDS-E Valves are
designed to accommodate test gags for use
with each type of cap. In the case of the Type C
cap with lifting lever, the lifting lever assembly
must be replaced with a hydrostatic test cap
and test rod prior to hydrostatic testing. When
test rods are used, care must be exercised to
prevent overtightening that could damage the
valve spindle and valve seats. Generally, a test
rod which is hand tight will provide sufficient
force to hold the valve closed.
After the hydrostatic test, the test rod (gag)
must be removed and replaced by either a cap
plug or a cap not fitted with a test rod.

4.2 Hydrostatic test of outlet system
When a hydrostatic test must be conducted
on the outlet piping system, with the valve in
place, special consideration must be given
not to exceed the design pressure limits of
the downstream side of the pressure relief
valve. The outlet side of a pressure relief valve
is known as the secondary pressure zone.
This zone is normally designed to a lower
pressure rating than the inlet and frequently is
designed to a lower pressure rating than the
outlet flange. This is true particularly in the
case of balanced bellows or diaphragm designs
and in the larger valve sizes.
Consult relevant product specifications
for the back pressure design limits of
the Style JOS-E/JBS-E/JBSBP-E/JDS-E or
JLT-E Valves.
CAUTION
Bellows and Diaphragm valves must have an open
bonnet vent.
Non bellows and diaphragm valves must have a
bonnet plug installed.

INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE INSTRUCTIONS
5 SETTING, TESTING AND ADJUSTMENTS
5.1 New valves
Every new Crosby J-Series Pressure Relief
Valve is tested and sealed prior to shipment by
following ASME Section XIII 3.6. The external
adjustment points of each valve are sealed to
ensure that no changes have been made to the
valve after shipment and that the valve has not
been disassembled or tampered with. The seals
and nameplates are your assurance that the
valve has been built and tested to the applicable
Codes and Standards and are the physical
evidence of our product warranty.
All new Crosby J-Series Valves are tested
fully prior to shipment on the appropriate
testing medium, so there is no need to
pre-test the valve prior to installation. If
pre-testing is required, in order to maintain
the product warranty, an Emerson authorized
service organization should be contacted to
perform the testing. Contact your local sales
representative or visit our website to locate the
authorized service organization closest to your
location. By choosing an Emerson authorized
service organization to perform testing you can
be assured that the correct testing procedure
is followed which will save time and cost by
avoiding possible valve damage caused by
improper testing methods.
In any event, if pre-testing is to be performed,
several important cautions should be observed.
First it is vital that the appropriate test fluid is
used to test any valve. See Section 5.5. This will
ensure accuracy of the test results as well as
avoid possible damage to the valve.
All Crosby J-Series valves are tested for seat
tightness after the final set point test and prior
to shipment from the factory. If further seat
tightness testing is required before installation,
it is recommended that the test be performed
prior to any set point verification testing.
Repeated pressure testing of a metal seated
valve can cause damage to the sealing surfaces
leading to seat leakage.
Testing on a low volume test stand requires
specific testing techniques in order to ensure
accurate test results and to avoid damage to the
sealing surfaces of the valve. In many cases this
requires temporary adjustment of the nozzle
ring during the test as described in Section 5.8
and specifically in Section 5.8.1. For valves with
set points in excess of 500 psig (3447 kPa), it is
recommended that when testing on a low volume
test bench, the lift be restricted temporarily by
use of a gag or other suitable device. When a test
rod is used,it is recommended that the test rod
be installed until the rod contacts the spindle and
then backed off approximately one-half turn.
However, it is good practice to inspect the valve
prior to installation.
5.3 Valves removed from service
Valves being removed from service should
be tested on a shop test bench before being
disassembled to determine the set pressure
and seat tightness. This is an important
phase of the maintenance routine and the test
results should be recorded for review and
determination of necessary corrective action.
The 'as received from service' condition
of a pressure relief valve is a most useful
tool in establishing the proper time interval
between inspections.
5.4 The test bench
The quality and condition of the shop test bench
is paramount to obtaining proper test results.
The test bench must be free of leaks and the
test fluid must be clean. Solids or other foreign
material in the test medium will damage the
seating surfaces of the pressure relief valve
being tested.
The test pressure gauge must be calibrated
and have a range proper to the pressure level
of the valve setting. Set pressure should fall
within the middle third of the dial range of the
test gauge. The test bench provides an accurate
and convenient facility for determining valve
set pressure and seat tightness. It does not
duplicate all of the field conditions to which
a pressure relief valve will be exposed while
in service. It is not practical to attempt to
measure relieving capacity or blowdown using
a test bench.
5.5 Test fluids - set pressure test
The test fluid should be air or nitrogen for
valves used on gas and vapor service and water
for valves used on liquid service. Valves for
steam service should be tested on steam.
It may be necessary to make a correction to
the adjusted set pressure to compensate for
the difference in temperature of the test fluids
(see appropriate instruction).
5.2 Reconditioned valves
Valves which have not been in service for
extended periods due to plant shutdown or
long term storage, or valves which have been
repaired or reconditioned, also should be tested
before being put into operation.
CAUTION
To prevent valve damage, seat leakage and
inaccurate set pressure, the testing procedure
listed in this manual should be followed. .
This inspection determines any damage which
may have occurred due to rough handling in
transit or storage and initiates appropriate
service records.

5.6 Valve operation
Crosby Style JOS-E/JBS-E/JBSBP-E/JDS-E
Valves intended for compressible fluid service
and tested with air or steam will open with a
sharp clear popping action at the set point.
Style JLT-E valves for liquid service tested with
water are considered open when there is a
continuous unbroken stream of liquid flowing
from the valve.
5.7 Set pressure changes
Set pressure changes beyond the specified
spring range will necessitate a change in the
valve spring assembly consisting of the spring
and two fitted spring washers. The new spring
and washers must be obtained from Emerson
and the valve must be reset by an authorized
valve repair facility.

5.8 Set pressure adjustment
Before making any adjustments, reduce the
test pressure under the valve seat to at least
10% below the stamped set pressure (or cold
differential test pressure - CDTP). This will
prevent seat damage due to turning of the disc
on the nozzle seat and minimize the chance of
an inadvertent valve opening. A strong (high)
ring position is necessary to obtain a good clean
popping action of the valve on air or gas with
the limited volume available on the test bench.
5.8.1 (Not required for testing on liquid). Remove
the nozzle ring set screw and raise the
nozzle ring until it touches the disc holder,
then back it down two (2) notches. Exercise
care in counting the number of notches
moved so that the ring can be returned to
its proper position following testing.
Moving the notches on the nozzle ring to
the left will lower the nozzle ring.
Replace the nozzle ring set screw before
each set pressure test. The set screw
must engage one of the ring notches,
being careful that it does not bear on the
top of a tooth.
5.8.2 Remove the cap or lifting lever following
the instruction for valve disassembly
(see Section 6.2).
5.8.3 Loosen the adjusting bolt nut and turn the
adjusting bolt clockwise to increase set
pressure or counterclockwise to reduce
set pressure.
5.8.4 Retighten the adjusting bolt nut following
each adjustment.
5.8.5 Two or three consecutive valve openings
at the same pressure are necessary to
verify the opening pressure accurately.
5.8.6 Opening pressure tolerance shall comply
with ASME Section XIII Table 3.6.3.1-2
for UV Designator as below or other
tolerance may be used so long as it meets
ASME requirements:
The set pressure tolerance for
pressure relief valves shall not exceed
±2 psi (15 kPa) for pressures up to and
including 70 psi (500 kPa) and ±3% for
pressures above 70 psi (500 kPa)
5.8.7 Once the set pressure has been
established, lower the nozzle ring to the
installed ring position as indicated in
Table 1 and replace the nozzle ring set
screw as described above. Seal wire the
cap and adjusting ring set screw with
identifying seals.
5.9 Nozzle ring settings
The nozzle ring adjustment is made at the
factory and resetting in service is seldom
necessary. Should it be necessary to change
blowdown or reduce valve simmer, the nozzle
ring may be adjusted as shown in Table 1 and
Table 2.
CAUTION
Should any adjustments be made while the valve is
installed on a pressurized system, the valve should
be gagged while ring adjustments are made to
prevent valve from inadvertently relieving.
NOTE
Minus sign indicates number of ring notches
below starting position of nozzle ring which is the

5.9.1 JOS-E, JBS-E, JBSBP-E, JDS-E
5.9.1.1 Remove the nozzle ring set screw
and insert a screwdriver to engage
the ring notches.
5.9.1.2 Turning the ring to the right raises the
ring, thereby increasing blowdown.
Turning the ring to the left lowers the
ring, thereby decreasing the blowdown.
5.9.1.3 Do not lower the nozzle ring to the
point where the valve begins to have
excessive simmer. Raising of the ring
will reduce simmer.
5.9.1.4 The nozzle ring should not be moved
more than two notches before retesting.
When making adjustments, always keep
count of the number of notches and
the direction in which the nozzle ring is
moved. This will permit returning to the
original setting in case of error.
5.10 Cold differential test pressure
adjustments
When a pressure relief valve is on a test
bench at room temperature and atmospheric
pressure, and is to be installed on a
system operating at a higher temperature
and/or a higher back pressure, a compensating
adjustment is necessary. The test pressure
required to have the valve open at the desired
set pressure under actual service conditions is
known as the cold differential test pressure.
5.10.1 Temperature correction
When a Crosby Style JOS-E/JBS-E/
JBSBP-E/JDS-E or JLT-E Valve is set
on air or water at room temperature
and then used at a higher service
temperature, the test pressure shall be
corrected to exceed the set pressure
using the temperature correction shown
in Table 3.

to JOS-H-E open bonnet or
steam service valves.

5.9.2 JLTJOS, JLTJBS, JLTJBSBP-E, JLTJDS
The Style JLT in the P, Q, R, T and T2
orifice sizes is preset at the factory and
cannot be adjusted externally in the field,
since the special contoured skirt on the
disc holder prevents engagement of the
set screw with the nozzle ring. As a result
the nozzle ring is not slotted and is held in
place by three set screws. The position of
the nozzle ring must be set prior to valve
assembly as follows:
5.9.2.1 Screw the nozzle ring (3) on
to the nozzle. The top of the
nozzle ring should be below the
nozzle seating surface.
5.9.2.2 Install the disc insert retention
clip (9) onto the disc insert.
Assemble the disc insert (8) and
disc holder (5). The disc insert
should snap into place using hand
force only.
5.9.2.3 Lower the disc holder and disc
insert carefully onto the nozzle.
5.9.2.4 Reach through the valve body
outlet and turn the nozzle ring
until it touches the disc holder
lightly. This is the highest
lock position.
5.9.2.5 Carefully remove the disc holder
and disc insert from the valve.
5.9.2.6 Lower the nozzle ring (turn to
the left) the total number of
revolutions shown in Table 2.
5.9.2.7 Carefully tighten each of the set
screws on the nozzle ring to hold
the ring in position.
5.10.2 Back pressure correction
Conventional valves without balancing
bellows or diaphragm with atmospheric
pressure at the outlet and intended
for use under elevated constant back
pressure conditions shall be adjusted
so that the test pressure is equal to the
set pressure minus the expected back
pressure. See example below:
Set pressure 100 psi (689 kPa)
Constant back pressure 10 psi (69 kPa)
Cold differential test pressure 90 psi (621 kPa)
In all instances, the spring should be selected
based on the cold differential test pressure;
in the example above, 90 psi (621 kPa). See
sample nameplate on page 5 which shows how
temperature and back pressure are indicated.

5.11 Seat leakage tests
Ambiguous terms such as 'bubble-tight',
'drop tight', 'zero leakage' and 'commercial
tightness' sometimes are used to describe seat
tightness. However, these terms lack uniform
definition and true practical meaning.
Test procedure API standard 527 provides a
standard for 'commercial' tightness and has
been adopted by industry and users in order to
clarify testing methods and tightness criteria.
This standard applies to flanged inlet nozzle
type pressure relief valves.
5.11.1 Testing with Air
 • Testing apparatus
 A typical test arrangement for determining
seat tightness for pressure relief valves
per API standard 527 is shown in Figure 5.
Leakage is measured using a 5/16 in. (7.9 mm)
OD tube with 0.035 in. (0.89 mm) wall.
The tube end is cut square and smooth, is
parallel to and ½ in. (12.7 mm) below the
surface of the water. A snap-on type test
clamp shown in Figure 6 is available.
• Testing Pressure
- All valves covered by this manual shall be
tested for seat tightness.
- Metal to metal and TFE seated valves with
set pressures or CDTP of 45 psig (3.10 bar)
or greater shall be tested at not less than
90% of the CDTP.
- Elastomer O-Ring seated valves with set
pressure or CDTP of 45 psig (3.10 bar) or
greater shall be tested at not less than
95% of the CDTP.
- All valves with set pressures or CDTP of
less than 45 psig (3.10 bar) and greater
than or equal to 20 psig (1.3 bar) shall be
tested at a pressure equal to or greater
than 4.5 psig (0.31 bar) below the CDTP.
- All valves with set pressures or CDTP
below 20 psig (1.38 bar) and greater
than 7 psig (0.48 bar) shall be tested at a
pressure of not less than 75% of the CDTP.
- All valves with set pressure or CDTP of
7 psig (0.48 bar) and below shall be tested
at a pressure equal to or greater than
2 psig (0.14 bar) below the CDTP.
NOTE
The cover plate should be
fitted with a suitable device to
relieve body pressure in case of
accidental popping of valve
NOTE
The tube must be bent so that reservoir runs
parallel to face of coverplate

removed before the seat tightness test. Air may be
used to dry condensate.
• Acceptance Criteria
- For both metal- and soft-seated valves,
there shall be no audible or visible leakage
for one minute
5.11.4 Testing with Air for Open Bonnet Valve
Leakage shall be measured on open bonnet
valves and valves that do not have back
pressure integrity by filling the valve outlet
with water above the nozzle and the seating
surfaces. The valve outlet shall be partially
sealed with water to about 0.5 in. above
nozzle’s seating surface.
• Testing Pressure
- should be same as testing with air.
• Waiting Time
The seat leak pressure shall be maintained for
a period of not less than one (1) minute.
• Acceptance Criteria
The maximum allowable leakage rate for

needed again when reassembling the
valve. (For Style JLT P through T2 orifice
refer to 6.2.13)
6.2.3 Loosen the adjusting bolt nut (25).
Before releasing the spring load, make
note of the depth of the adjusting bolt
in the bonnet by measuring the height
of the adjustment bolt with a pair of
dial calipers or depth micrometer.
This measurement will help when
reassembling the valve to its approximate
original setting.
6.2.4 Release all of the spring load by
rotating the adjusting bolt (24) in a
counterclockwise direction.
6.2.5 Remove the bonnet stud nuts (22). For

may be necessary to use a suitable solvent to aid
in removal.
6.2.13 Remove the nozzle ring (3) from the
nozzle (2) by turning counterclockwise. For
styles (JLTJOS-E, JLTJBS-E, JLTJBSBP-E,
or JLTJDS-E) orifice sizes P through T2
remove the nozzle ring lock screws (13)
with the appropriate allen head wrench
before removing the nozzle ring.
6.2.14 Remove the nozzle (2) from the valve
body (1) if necessary. Unless the valve
seat on the nozzle has been damaged
mechanically or shows signs of corrosive
attack, it will not be necessary to remove
the nozzle. In most cases the nozzle can
be reconditioned without removal from the
valve body. To remove the nozzle, turn the
valve body over taking care not to damage
the bonnet studs (21). Turn the nozzle
counterclockwise by using the wrench flats
on the nozzle flange or a nozzle wrench
designed to clamp onto the nozzle flange.
6.3 Cleaning
External parts such as the valve body, bonnet
and cap should be cleaned by immersion in a
bath such as hot Oakite solution or equivalent.
These external parts may be cleaned by wire
brushing, provided the brushes used do not
damage nor contaminate the base metals.
Only clean stainless-steel brushes should be
used on stainless steel components.
The internal parts such as the guide, disc
holder, disc insert, nozzle ring and spindle
should be cleaned by immersion in a
commercial high alkaline detergent.
Guiding surfaces on the disc holder and guide
may be polished using a fine emery cloth. The
bellows and other metal parts may be cleaned
using acetone or alcohol, then rinsed with clean
tap water and dried.

6.4 Inspection
Check all valve parts for wear and corrosion.
The valve seats on both the nozzle and disc
insert must be examined to determine if they
have been damaged. Most often, lapping the
valve seats is all that is necessary to restore
them to their original condition.
If the inspection shows that the valve seats are
damaged badly, remachining will be necessary
or it may be advisable to replace these parts.
When the time element is a factor, it may be
advantageous to replace damaged parts from
spare parts stock, thereby permitting the
replaced part to be checked and reworked at
leisure. (See Figure 11 and Table 8 for nozzle
critical dimensions). The valve spring (18)
should be inspected for evidence of cracking,
pitting or deformation. The bellows (6B)
in a Style JBS-E, JBSBP-E, JLTJBS-E, and
JLTJBSBP-E valve and
diaphragm (7C) in a Style JDS-E and JLTJDS-E
valves should be inspected for evidence
of cracking, pitting or deformation that might
develop into a leak.The bearing surfaces on
the guide and disc holder should be checked
for residual product build up and any evidence
of scoring. Inspection of valve components is
important to ensure proper valve performance.
Damaged valve parts must be repaired
or replaced.
Spindle assemblies should be checked for
excessive runout. For D to K orifice the total
runout between the spindle point to top of the
spindle rod should be less than 0.015 in.
(0.38 mm). For L orifice and larger it should be
less than 0.030 in. (0.80 mm).
Check and inspect all gaskets for evidence of
damage (creases, gouges, cuts) or corrosion.
Metal gaskets may be re-used if found to be
undamaged. All organic fiber or soft gaskets
should be replaced.

6.5 Reconditioning of valve seats
The tightness of a valve and its proper
operation depend directly on the condition of
the seats. Many pressure relief valve problems
are due to eroded or damaged seats.
The standard Crosby Style JOS-E/JBS-E/
JBSBP-E/JDS-E/JLT-E Valve is constructed
with a flat metal-to-metal seat. It is important
that seating surfaces be refurbished properly
by lapping with a flat cast iron lap coated with
the correct lapping compound.
6.5.1 Lapping procedures
 Unless the seats have been damaged
badly by dirt or scale, lapping the seating
surfaces should restore them to their
original condition. Never lap the disc
insert against the nozzle. Lap each part
separately against a cast-iron lapping
block of the proper size. These blocks hold
the lapping compound in their surface
pores and must be recharged frequently.
Lap the block against the seat. Never
rotate the block continuously, but use an
 As the lapping nears completion, only the
compound left in the pores of the block
should be present. This should give a very
smooth finish. If scratches appear, the
cause is probably dirty lapping compound.
These scratches should be removed by
using compound free from foreign material.
 Disc inserts should be lapped in the same
way as nozzles. The disc insert must be
removed from the holder before lapping.
Before the disc insert is placed back in
the holder all foreign material should be
removed from both parts. The insert must
be free when in the holder. If the disc insert
is damaged too badly to be reconditioned
by lapping, it should be replaced.
 Remachining the insert will change critical
dimensions, affect the action of the valve
and is not recommended.
• Lapping blocks
Lapping blocks are made of a special
grade of annealed cast iron. There is a
block for each orifice size. Each block
has two perfectly flat working sides and
it is essential that they retain this high
degree of flatness to produce a truly flat
seating surface on either the disc insert
or the nozzle. Before a lapping block is
used, it should be checked for flatness and
reconditioned after use on a lapping plate.
The block should be lapped in a figure
eight motion, applying uniform pressure
while rotating the lapping block against
the plate as shown in Figure 10.
• Lapping compounds
Experience has proven that medium
coarse, medium fine and polish lapping
compounds will condition any damaged
pressure relief valve seat properly except
where the damage requires remachining.
The following lapping compounds, or their
commercial equivalents are suggested:
oscillating motion. Extreme care should
be taken throughout to make certain
that the seats are kept perfectly flat.
If considerable lapping is required, spread
a thin coat of medium coarse lapping
compound on the block. After lapping with
the medium coarse compound, lap again
with a medium grade compound. Unless
much lapping is called for, the first step
can be omitted. Next, lap again using a
fine grade compound. When all nicks
and marks have disappeared, remove all
the compound from the block and seat.
Apply polish compound to another block
and lap the seat.

INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE INSTRUCTIONS
6.5.2 Machining of nozzle seats
If machining of the nozzle seat or
other major repairs are necessary, it is
recommended that the valve be returned
to an authorized Emerson Service Center
for repair. All parts must be machined
accurately per Emerson specifications.
No pressure relief valve will be tight,
nor will it operate properly unless all
parts are machined correctly. The most
satisfactory way to machine a nozzle is to
remove it from the valve body. However,
it may also be machined while assembled
within the valve body. In any event, it is
vitally important that the seating surfaces
run absolutely true before machining.

INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE INSTRUCTIONS
6.6 Assembly
All components should be clean. Before
assembling the following parts, lubricate with
pure nickel 'Never-Seez®' or equivalent (See
Figure 12).
• Nozzle to body threads.
• Nozzle and body sealing surface.
• All studs and nuts.
• Spindle rod threads.
• Spring spacer bevels.
• Set screw threads.
• Adjusting bolt and bonnet threads.
• Bonnet pipe plug (JOS-E
and JLTJOS-E only).
• Cap threads.
• Dog shaft bearing threads.
• Spindle point thrust bearing.
• Body, bonnet, cap set screw gaskets and
bellows tailpiece gasket.
• Disc insert bearing.
• D through H orifice Disc holder top
threads (JDS-E and JLTJDS-E only) by
using Loctite®243.
• J through T orifice Disc holder top threads
(JDS-E and JLTJDS-E only).
Special attention should be given to the guiding
surfaces, bearing surfaces, threaded surfaces,
and gasket surfaces to ensure that they are
clean, undamaged, and ready for assembly.
For parts identification, refer to Figure 1.
Please refer to the respective manufacturer’s
latest documentation on usage, dry time,
curing time etc. for proper performance. Metal
gaskets and O-ring soft seals (if applicable)
should be replaced during each repair for best
performance. Metal gaskets can be re-used if
not damaged or corroded.
6.6.1 Apply lubricant to the flange surface
in contact with the valve body (1)
and on the body to nozzle threads.
Screw the nozzle (2) into the
valve body (1) and tighten with the
appropriate nozzle wrench.
6.6.2 Screw the nozzle ring (3) onto the nozzle (2).
The top of the nozzle ring should be above
the nozzle seating surface. This prevents
damaging the seating surfaces during
installation of the disc holder assembly.
6.6.3 If removed, install the retention clip (9)
onto the disc insert (8) by placing the
retention clip over the groove of the disc
insert and pushing into the groove. For
O-ring soft seat (see Figure 22) lightly
coat the new O-ring (10) with “Parker
Super O-Lube” place the O-ring around
the radius lip of the O-ring retainer (11)
and install into the disc insert (8) being
careful not to pinch the O-ring, place
a small amount of Loctite® 242 (or
FIGURE 13
Recommended lubrication points
equivalent removable thread lock)
onto the O-ring retainer screw(s)
threads (12) thread the retainer screw(s)
into the disc insert finger tight. Using
the proper allen head wrench securely
tighten the retainer screw(s). Place the
disc insert (8) into the disc holder (5)
and push on the disc insert until it snaps
into the disc holder using hand force
only. Rocking the disc insert may aid in
snaping into place.
CAUTION
Safety precautions should be followed whenever
heavy parts are being lifted or transported.
Dropping the disc holder assembly may dislodge
the disc insert.
6.6.4 For bellows valves (JBS-E/JLTJBS-E/
JBSBP-E/JLTJBSBP-E), place the
disc holder (5) in a vise (or 3 jaw vise
for larger sizes) as shown in Figure 7.
Install the new tailpiece gasket (29) onto
the disc holder (5). Screw the bellows
assembly (6) onto the disc holder by
holding the bellows tailpiece (6A),
tighten the bellows using the flats on
the tailpiece with a suitable wrench. For
Bellows Leak Detection style JBSBP-E/
JLTJBSBP-E See paragraph 6.8
for assembly.
NOTE
Special care should be taken to not damage
the bellows, never use a pipe wrench to
tighten the tailpiece (6A).
6.6.5 Assemble the disc holder (5) and
guide (15), by sliding the guide over the
disc holder. For restricted lift styles “RL”
install the restricted lift spacer over the
disc holder prior to installing the guide
(See Figure 18, paragraph 6.7).
NOTE
For orifice sizes D and E only on styles JOS-E/
JBS-E/JLTJOS-E/JLTJBS-E the guide lift stop
protrudes up into the valve bonnet (20), orifice
sizes F through T2 the guide lift stop protrudes
down into the body (1). For orifice sizes D
through T2 on styles JDS-E/JLTJDS-E/JBSBP-E/
JLTJBSBP-E the guide lift stop protrudes down
into the valve body (1). For D/E orifice the bonnet
adapter (23) is used in lieu of the guide (15).

INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE INSTRUCTIONS
a. For styles JDS-E/JLTJDS-E with the
disc holder (5) in the vise (or 3 jaw
vise), place the diaphragm gasket (7A)
onto the shoulder of the disc holder
being careful to make sure the
diaphragm gasket rests squarely
on the shoulder of the disc holder
then stack the spacer (7B) onto the
diaphragm gasket, keep the nonserration surface of the spacer against
the diaphragm gasket.
NOTE
Visually check for any burrs on the spacer (7B)
serration prior to assembling.
b. Install the diaphragm (7C) onto the
spacer (7B) through the center hole,
keep the rubber side of the diaphragm
towards the serration surface of the
spacer. Fold down the diaphragm to be
convoluted around the spacer so that
diaphragm rests on the guide flatly and
evenly in the circumferential direction.
c. Place the diaphragm plate (7D) onto
the diaphragm (7C), serration side
down towards the diaphragm. Stack the
wedge lock washer set (7E) above the
diaphragm plate (7D) keep the pair of
washers together. (See Figure 15 for the
correct paired washer stacking). (See
Figure 14 for JDS assembly).
NOTE
Visually check for any burrs on the diaphragm
plate (7D) serration surface prior to assembling.
d. For D through H orifice sizes, place
a small amount of Loctite® 243
(removable thread locker) onto the
disc holder top threads (5). For J
through T2 orifice sizes, lubricate the
disc holder top threads (5) with pure
Nickle “Never-Seez®” or equivalent.
Screw the lock washer nut (7F) onto
the disc holder (5) finger tight. Using
the proper wrench tighten the nut
to the torque required per Table 10.
The torque shall be increased slowly
to avoid diaphragm (7C) rotation
and potential diaphragm gasket (7A)
damage. The torque shall not exceed
the maximum value as specified
in Table 10.
e. Install the bonnet adapter (23)
by positioning the counter
bore on the O.D. of the
diaphragm (7C) and guide (15).
6.6.6 Install the new bottom guide gasket (28),
into the recess in the body (1) below
the guide (15). For bellows valves, the
bellows flange eliminates the need for
the bottom guide gasket (28).
Figure 14
JDS Assembly
6.6.7 While holding the top of the disc
holder (5) install the disc holder and
guide assembly into the body (1). Align
the hole in the guide with the body
outlet. Once guide is seated, the disc
holder (5) and disc insert (8) assembly,
can be lowered into the nozzle (2). By
reaching into the valve outlet lower the
nozzle ring (3) clockwise below the seat
so that it moves freely. For JLTJOS-E/
JLTJBS-E/JLTJDS-E/JLTJBSBP-E
orifice sizes P-T2 only, turn the nozzle
ring (3) counter-clockwise until it
touches the disc holder (5). Remove the
disc holder guide and disc assembly and
position the nozzle ring (13) (per Table 2),
then tighten the three set screws (13)
with the appropriate allen-head wrench.
Once the set screws are installed
re-install the disc holder, guide, and
disc assembly.
NOTE
It may be required for orifice sizes L-T2 to
install the spindle (16) and cotter pins (17) and
use a mechanical lifting aid attached to the
spindle threads.
6.6.8 Position the upper gasket (28) onto the
guide, line up the O.D. of the gasket with
the O.D. of the guide. For diaphragm
type JDS position the bonnet adapter
gasket (31) above the bonnet adapter (23).
Place the spring (18) and washers (19)
onto the spindle (16) and assemble the
spindle to the disc holder. Orifice sizes L
through T2 require two cotter pins (17) to
attach the spindle to the disc holder (5) in
the two pre-drilled holes. No cotter pins
are required in orifice sizes D-K.
6.6.9 Lower the bonnet (28) over the
spindle (16) and spring assembly (18-19)
onto the bonnet studs (21) in the body (1).
Position the bonnet counter bore gasket
surface on the O.D. of the guide (15)
or bonnet adapter (23) as applicable.
The bonnet vent should face the outlet
direction unless otherwise specified.
NOTE
The spindle and spring assembly for orifices L
through T2 will tend to shift to the side, special
care should be taken to hold the spring and
washer assembly upright before installing the
bonnet (20) this can be accomplished by placing
a sized block of wood (or any alternate spacer) on
two opposing sides between the bottom spring
washer (19) and the guide (15). Once the bonnet
clears the spindle the blocks or spacer must be
removed prior to lowering the bonnet into its final
seated position.

sequence of tightening to the maximum
torque value shown in Table 11. Then
starting with the Number 1 nut, tighten
each nut in order in a clockwise or
counterclockwise direction to a value no
greater than the maximum value shown
in Table 11.
6.6.11 Screw the adjusting bolt nut (25) onto
the adjusting bolt (24), then screw the
adjusting bolt and nut assembly into
the bonnet threads (24), tighten by
turning clockwise to apply force to the
spring and washers (18-19). The original
set pressure can be approximated by
screwing the adjustment bolt (24) down
to the original measurement taken
during disassembly.
NOTE
It may be necessary to hold the spindle (16) with
pliers (or two nuts tightened onto the spindle and
held by the bottom nut) or hold disc holder by
reaching into the valve outlet while tightening the
adjustment bolt to prevent damage to the seats.
6.6.12 For JOS-E/JBS-E/JDS-E/JBSBP-E
styles in air or gas service turn the
nozzle ring (3) counterclockwise until it
touches the disc holder (5), then lower
it clockwise two notches. This is the test
stand setting only, once valve setting
is complete, nozzle ring should be
adjusted by turning counterclockwise
until it touches the disc holder, then
adjusted down by turning clockwise to
the recommended position in Table 1.
For JLTJOS-E/JLTJBS-E/JLTJDS-E/
JLTJBSBP-E on liquid and air service
the nozzle ring (3) can be adjusted to the
recommended position in Tables 1 and 2
without presetting to two notches.
6.6.13 Place the new set screw gasket (27)
onto the set screw (4) and screw the set
screw into the body (1) the set screw
should engage the nozzle ring between
the slots allowing the nozzle ring to
move slightly back and forth after set
screw is tightened. For styles JLTJOS-E/
JLTJBS-E/JLTJBSBP-E/JLTJDS-E, P
through T2 orifice the set screw does not
engage the nozzle ring due to nozzle ring
is held by lock screws (13).
6.6.14 The valve is now ready for testing. After
testing, the following measures should
be taken:
• Be sure that adjusting bolt nut (25)
is locked.
• Return the nozzle ring (3) to either the
original recorded position or to the
recommended position shown in Table 1.
• Install the cap or lifting device. See
paragraph 6.9 for lifting lever assembly.
• Seal the external adjustments, cap or
lifting lever device and nozzle ring set

6.7 Restricted lift valves
Crosby JOS-E/JDS-E/JBS-E/JBSBP-E and
JLT-E Pressure Relief Valves are available
in a restricted lift version. The purpose of a
restricted lift valve is to more closely match
the required capacity of the protected vessel or
pipe with the actual and rated capacities of the
relief valve providing over-pressure protection.
Restricted lift (RL) versions of the J-Series may
be built by a certified Emerson manufacturing
facility or by an ASME certified Assembler with
the required certification specific to the RL
version (National Board certificates 01045 and
01382). Any ASME marked RL valve may be VR
repaired by a repair organization certified under
the National Board VR repair program. Existing
non- restricted lift versions of the J-Series may
be converted to the restricted lift version by
VR certificate holders. In addition existing RL
versions may have their lift modified using the
same procedures.
NOTE
Restricted lift valves may be identified by the restricted
lift nameplate by model number with “-RL".
6.7.1 Restricted lift valves have a limit spacer
that prevents the disc and disc holder
from lifting its limits. These valves may be
restricted to a minimum lift of 30% of the
full rated capacity or .080 in. (2.03 mm).It
is important to check lift on all restricted
lift valves to ensure accuracy of the
capacity on the nameplate. For production
purposes the spacers are precut for 10%
increments. 5% increments can be added
for K orifice and larger.
6.7.2 Determining the correct limit spacer height
• The nameplate capacity should
be as specified on the nameplate
or determined by calculation
(See example on page 21).
• The required lift should also
be specified on the nameplate
or determined by calculation
(See example on page 21).
• Select the limit spacer(s) to the
required limit spacer height
(See Tables 12 and 13).
6.7.3 Measure the valve lift.
• Install the limit spacer (see Figure 18)
with the chamfer down and reassemble
the valve as described in Steps 6.6.1
through 6.6.10.
Install bellows to disc holder first for
bellows valve, then install spacer.
• Measure the lift of the valve and
compare it with the required lift as given
on the restricted lift nameplate with
tolerance (-0.020 in., +0.020 in.
(-0.50 mm, +0.50 mm)).
• Based on the results, if the lift is not in
the tolerance:
If the actual lift is less than required, machine
the limit spacer as necessary to obtain the
required lift. (Machine chamfer, deburr and
polish before installation into the valve.)
If the actual lift is greater than required, obtain
a new next taller limit spacer, disassemble
the valve and return to section 6.7.3. (Machine
chamfer, deburr and polish before installation
into valve.)
• Once correct lift is obtained,
disassemble the valve.
• Ensure the limit spacer has been
chamfered to fit over the radius of the
disc holder. The limit spacer must be
installed so that the chamfered end is
mating to the back face of disc holder,
and not sitting on the disc holder radius.
• Prior assembly, verify the lift for
each valve.
FIGURE 18
Restricted lift spacer
CAUTION
Do not interchange internal parts or use a
different nozzle after a set of parts has been
custom-fit.
6.7.4 Assembly
Valves need to be assembled as per
section 6.6.
6.7.5 Restricted Lift Nameplate
For new restricted lift version valves, use
the restricted lift nameplate (See Figure 17.)
If a non-restricted lift J-Series PRV is
converted to the RL version, or if the
restricted lift is changed on an existing
RL version valve the following procedure
regarding nameplates should be followed.
• The information on the original ASME
nameplate which is changed by the
conversion, such as model number,
capacity and restricted lift should be
lightly etched out but still legible.
• Information changed by conversion of
the valve or change to the restricted
lift shall be included on the repair
nameplate to serve as a record of
the conversion and its effect on the
performance of the PRV.

6.8 Bellows Leak Detection Valves
The Crosby J-Series Bellows Leak Detection
feature is based on two technologies: a backup
piston that guarantees balanced operation
if the bellows ruptures and a Rosemount™
pressure transmitter that monitors the
pressure chamber between the piston and the
bellows. The steps below show the high-level
assembly procedure.
The rest of the parts that are not discussed
herein will follow the standard assembly
procedure used for standard J-Series in
section 6.6 JBS-E or JLTJBS-E.
6.8.1 Bellows leak detection assembly
a. As outlined in 6.6.4 place the disc
holder (5) in a vise (or 3 jaw-vise
for larger sizes) as shown in
Figure 7. Install the new tailpiece
gasket (29) onto the disc holder (5).
Screw the bellows assembly (6) onto
the disc holder by holding the bellows
tailpiece (6A), tighten the bellows
using the flats on the tailpiece with a
suitable wrench. Install the guide (15)
with lift stop protruding downward
toward the base of the disc holder (5).
For restricted lift styles “RL” install
the restricted lift spacer over the disc
holder prior to installing the guide (See
Figure 18, paragraph 6.7). D/E orifice
uses the bonnet adapter (23) in lieu of
the guide (15).
b. Refer to Table 14, select the
appropriate primer and Loctite® and
apply on the external threads of the
disc holder (5) and internal threads of
the Piston (5G). Directions for use can
be found

Bellows leak detection feature
c. Thread piston (5G) on the disc
holder (5) to the torque value specified
in Table 15. The piston (5G) has
two flats so a torque wrench with
adjustable wrench adaptor may be
required. The only exception is the
D orifice which has two slots for
the spanner.
d. After threading the piston (5G) to the
disc holder (5A) follow the curing time
listed in Table 14 before assembling
into the valve.
e. Install the disc insert (8) see
paragraph 6.6.3.
f. Apply ample lubricant on the top
of the Piston (5G) head for designs
where the Piston (5G) contacts the
Spindle Assembly (16).

6.9 Assembly of cap and lifting lever devices
Styles JOS-E/JBS-E/JBSBP-E/JDS-E and
JLT-E Pressure Relief Valves are furnished
with several different caps and lifting lever
devices. The following describes assembly of
the available types of cap construction.
(Disassembly is the reverse of assembly).
For part identification refer to Figure 21.
• Type A and J
Install the cap gasket and screw the cap onto
the top of the bonnet. Tighten the cap with a
strap wrench.
• Type B and K
Install the cap gasket and screw the cap onto
the top of the bonnet. Tighten the cap with
a strap wrench. Install the cap plug gasket
and screw cap plug into the cap. The test rod
is installed only during system hydrostatic
testing. Never install the test rod unless
performing system hydrostatic testing.
• Type C
Screw the spindle nut onto the spindle.
Place the cap on the bonnet. Install the forked
lever and forked lever pin. Attach the lever to
the cap using the lever pin and secure with
the lever pin cotter.
Adjust the spindle nut until the forked
lever rests on the lever and there is a
1/16 in. (1.58 mm) minimum of play between
the forked lever and the spindle nut. The
spindle nut may be adjusted by removing the
forked lever pin, forked lever and cap. When
the spindle nut is in proper adjustment, install
the spindle nut cotter pin. Replace the cap
and forked lever and install the forked lever
pin and forked lever pin cotter.
Position the lever opposite the valve outlet
and install the four (4) cap set screws and
tighten them against the groove in the top of
the bonnet.
• Type D
Install the cap gasket on the bonnet. Screw
the spindle nut onto the spindle. Place the
dog in the cap and install the dog shaft so
that the dog is horizontal and the square
on the end of the dog shaft has a corner on
top. With the dog shaft in the position above,
scribe a horizontal line on the end of the dog
shaft. This line must be horizontal when the
lifting gear is finally installed on the valve.
Install the dog shaft O-ring in the dog shaft
bearing and place the dog shaft bearing
gasket on the dog shaft bearing.
Screw the dog shaft bearing into the cap.
Rotate the dog shaft so that the dog is
pointing down and install the cap assembly
onto the bonnet. Rotate the dog shaft so that
the dog contacts the spindle nut. With the
scribed line horizontal, remove the assembly
and adjust the position of the spindle nut.
Repeat the operation until the scribed line is
horizontal when the dog contacts the spindle.
Remove the assembly and install the spindle
nut cotter pin.
Install the lifting gear assembly onto the
bonnet and secure it with cap studs and nuts.
For Type D lifting levers that have two part
caps (cap and cap top) the above procedure
is accomplished more easily. After the cap is
screwed to the bonnet, the positioning of the
dog shaft is the same as above except that the
positioning of the spindle nut is performed
last through the open end of the cap.
With the dog in the horizontal position,
screw the spindle nut onto the spindle until
it contacts the dog. Install the spindle nut
cotter, cap top gasket and screw the cap top
into the cap.
• Type E
Assembly of Type E lifting lever is identical
to Type D with the addition of the cap plug
gasket and cap plug. The test rod is installed
only during system hydrostatic testing.
Never install the test rod unless performing
system hydrostatic test.
• Type G and L
Install the cap studs to the bonnet top.
Place the cap gasket onto the bonnet and the
cap onto the cap studs. Install and tighten cap
stud nuts.
• Type H and M
Assembly of Type H and M is identical to
Type G and L with the addition of the cap plug
gasket and cap plug. The test rod is installed
only during system hydrostatic testing. Never
install the test rod unless performing system
hydrostatic test.

INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE INSTRUCTIONS
7 STYLE VARIATIONS
The Crosby Style JOS-E Pressure Relief
Valve was designed with flexibility and
interchangeability in mind. Retrofitting from
conventional to balanced bellows or diaphragm
high performance liquid trim or soft seat design
is accomplished with a minimum number
of new parts. These style retrofits can be
accomplished at lowest possible cost.
• Balanced bellows
A Crosby JOS-E Conventional Non-bellows
Pressure Relief Valve may be converted
to a Style JBS-E balanced bellows valve
simply by adding the bellows assembly and
tailpiece gasket.
• Balanced diaphragms
A Crosby JOS-E Conventional Non-bellows
Pressure Relief Valve may be converted to
a Style JDS-E balanced diaphragm valve by
replacing with threaded disc holder and guide
and adding the diaphragms assembly and
bonnet adapter.
• JLT liquid trim
Crosby Style JOS-E/JBS-E/JDS-E Pressure
Relief Valves in D to T2 orifice sizes may be
converted to high performance JLT liquid
service design simply by replacing the
standard disc holder with a JLT disc holder,
or vice versa. For P to T2 orifice sizes, a new
nozzle ring is also required.
• O-ring soft seat design
Crosby Style JOS-E/JBS-E/JDS-E Pressure
Relief Valves in all orifice sizes may be
converted from the standard metal-tometal seats to an exceptionally tight soft
seat design. This style conversion can be
accomplished by replacing the standard
disc insert and nozzle with parts adapted to
accommodate the soft seat design.
The soft seat design uses standard size
O-rings and is capable of handling pressures
to 1480 psig (10,204 kPa). Standard O-ring
materials include NBR, EPR, FKM, FFKM,
Silicone and PTFE (see Figure 22.)
• Bellows leak detection
A Crosby JOS-E Conventional Non-Bellows
may be upgraded by replacing the disc
holder, guide and installing the bellows
assembly, tailpiece gasket, piston, bonnet
adapter, bonnet studs, tubing, fittings,
bracket, and pressure transmitter. A
Crosby JBS-E Balanced Bellows may be
upgraded by replacing the disc holder, guide
and installing the piston, bonnet adapter,
bonnet studs, tubing, fittings, bracket, and
pressure transmitter.
NOTE
When converting any of the styles above the spring
and/or spring pressure range may change, consult the
Emerson representative for correct spring and range.

8 SERVICE RECORDS FIGURE 22
Service records should be completed before
a valve is returned to service. These records
are important and will provide guidance on
establishing time intervals between repairs as
well as providing the historical record of repairs
and service conditions. Well kept records will
be useful in predicting when to retire a valve
and which spare parts should be maintained in
inventory to ensure uninterrupted plant operation.
9 SPARE PARTS
When ordering spare parts, the valve shop
number, assembly number or serial number
should be given together with set pressure, part
name and item number, valve size and style.
Spare parts may be ordered from any Emerson
regional sales office or representative.
10 TROUBLE SHOOTING PRESSURE
RELIEF VALVES
Troubles encountered with pressure relief
valves can affect the life and performance of
the valve vitally and must be corrected at the
first possible opportunity.
Failure of a pressure relief valve to function
properly could result in the rupture of a line or
vessel jeopardizing the safety of personnel and
causing damage to property and equipment.
Some of the most common troubles and
the recommended correction measures are
discussed in the following paragraphs.
10.1 Seat leakage
A leaking valve allows fluids to circulate into
the secondary pressure zone of the valve
where it can cause corrosion of the guide and
valve spring.
When a leaking valve problem is not
addressed immediately, the leakage
itself will further contribute to seat
damage through erosion (wire-drawing).
10.1.1 Seats damaged by foreign matter
Seating surfaces may be damaged
when hard foreign particles such as mill
scale, welding spatter, coke and dirt are
trapped between the seats. While this
type of damage usually occurs while the
valve is in service, it may also happen in
the maintenance shop. Every precaution
should be taken to clean the process
system before installing a pressure relief
valve and to test the valve using only
clean fluids.
Generally, damaged seating surfaces
are reconditioned by lapping. Most often
small pits and scratches may be removed
by lapping alone. More extensive damage
will also require remachining prior
to lapping.
In some instances, valve construction can
be changed to reduce the effects of seat
leakage. The use of an O-ring soft seat
when applicable will minimize leakage
and thus eliminate the associated
corrosion and erosion problems. If it is
not possible to use a soft seated valve,
or if the corrosive media is present
in the exhaust system, conversion to
a Style JBS-E and JBSBP-E bellows
seated valve will isolate and protect
the guides and valve spring from any
corrosive fluids.

INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE INSTRUCTIONS
10.1.2 Distortion from piping strains
Valve bodies can be distorted by
excessive piping loads causing seat
leakage. Both inlet and discharge
piping must be supported properly and
anchored so that high bending loads are
not transmitted to the valve body.
10.1.3 Operating pressure too close to
set pressure
A carefully lapped metal-to-metal
seated valve will be commercially tight
at a pressure approximately ten percent
under the set pressure or 5 psi (34 kPa),
whichever is greater. Consequently, this
minimum pressure differential should be
maintained between set and operating
pressure to avoid seat leakage problems.
10.1.4 Chatter
Oversized valves, excessive pressure drop
in the inlet lines, restrictions in the inlet
line, too great a build up of back pressure
or pulsating inlet pressure will cause
instability to the pressure relief valve. In
such installations, the pressure under the
valve disc may be great enough to cause
the valve to open but, as soon as flow is
established, the pressure drops allowing
the valve to close immediately. This cycle
of opening and closing sometimes occurs
at very high frequency causing severe
seat damage, sometimes beyond repair.
Proper valve selection and installation
techniques are paramount to reliable
valve performance.
10.1.5 Incorrectly adjusting lifting gear
A space of 1/16 in. (1.58 mm) minimum
should always be provided between the
lifting device and the spindle lift nut.
Failure to provide sufficient clearance
may result in inadvertent contact causing
a slight shift in the opening pressure.

applicable codes and standards.
The information, specifications and technical data
(the 'Specifications') contained in this document
are subject to change without notice. Emerson
does not warrant that the specifications are
current and assumes no responsibility for the use
or misuse thereof.
The purchaser should verify that there have been
no changes to the specifications prior to use.
10.1.6 Other causes of seat leakage
Improper alignment of the spindle, too
much clearance between the valve spring
and the spring washers, or improper
bearing contact between the adjusting
bolt and the spring washers, spindle
and disc holder or spindle and lower
spring washer may cause seat leakage
problems. Spindles should be checked
for straightness and springs and spring
washers should be fitted properly and
kept together as a spring assembly.
10.1.7 Corrosion
Corrosion may result in pitting of valve
parts, failure of various valve parts, build
up of corrosive products and general
deterioration of the valve materials.
Generally, corrosive attack is controlled
through selection of suitable materials
or by employing a bellows or diaphragm
to isolate the valve spring, adjusting bolt,
spindle and guiding surfaces from the
corrosive attack of the process fluid.
Environmental corrosion attacks all
exposed surfaces, including studs and
nuts. In general, the materials required
for a particular service are dictated
by the temperature, pressure and the
degree of corrosion resistance required.
