ANDERSON GREENWOOD SERIES 800 POSRV
INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE INSTRUCTIONS
1.1 General
The Anderson Greenwood Series 800 valve is
designed for modulating action. The main valve
will open at nameplate set, but only an amount
proportional to the relieving capacity required.
As process pressure increases, the valve will
open more and be in full lift at 110% of set.
The main valve uses the principle of
pressurizing the larger area of a differential
area piston with line pressure to hold the piston
closed up to set pressure. At set pressure, the
pilot relieves, depressurizing the volume on the
larger area side of the piston. Line pressure
acting on the smaller area side causes it to
lift, permitting discharge from the main valve.
As capacity relief of the system is satisfied,
system pressure will begin to decrease. When
it does, the pilot will actuate and direct system
pressure to the larger area side of the main
valve piston to close it.
The pilot is the non-flowing type. With the main
valve open and relieving at steady pressure,
no process gas or fluid flows through the pilot.
1.2 Installation
Both inlet and outlet may be standard ANSI
flanges or ANSI pipe threaded connections and
are to be installed in accordance with accepted
piping practices.When remote pressure pick-up
is used the pilot supply tube is connected to a
remote location rather than to the inlet neck
of the valve. A block valve in the remote pilot
supply line is not recommended. If one is used
it must be opened before pressurizing the
main valve.
Note: remote pressure pick-up piping must
have the equivalent flow area of ⅜” tubing for
lengths up to 100 feet. For lengths greater
than this, consult factory.
For valves supplied with eyebolts, follow
the instructions in Anderson Greenwood
Pilot operated safety relief valves
05-9040-352 (VCOSI-06034 Operating and
Safety Instructions) pertaining to the safe use
and storage of eyebolts.
Refer to Anderson Greenwood Pilot operated
safety relief valves 05-9040-372 (VCIOM-03099
Winterization Guidelines) and 05-9040-352
for more information regarding Winterization
requirements.
1.3 Start-up
There must be pressure at the valve inlet or at
the pilot inlet/sense port for valves with remote
sense to establish a differential force across
the piston and “load” it in the closed position.
Pressure must pass through the pilot and exert
force on the top of the piston. On normal plant
start-up the valve will close itself as pressure
increases.
Before installation, these instructions must be carefully read and understood.

When process pressure changes, the pilot
actuates to change the lift of the main valve
seat disk. During these actuations a small
amount of gas or fluid flows through the
pilot and is discharged at the pilot outlet.
The set pressure range is 1481 psig to
7500 psig.

1.4 Maintenance
Anderson Greenwood recommended main valve
and pilot maintenance procedures including
pilot set pressure adjustment and valve
assembly testing are described in the following
paragraphs. Following these procedures in
a regular pressure relief valve maintenance
program appropriate for the specific operating
conditions will ensure satisfactory valve
performance and provide optimum service life.
Should the pressure/media requirements of a
pilot operated pressure relief valve be outside
the capabilities of the repair facility, contact
Anderson Greenwood for specific instructions
before starting any maintenance activity.
This manual is provided as a general guide for
the maintenance of the safety valves described
herein. It does not include procedures
covering all valve configurations and variations
manufactured by Anderson Greenwood. The
user is advised to contact Anderson Greenwood
or one of our authorized representatives for
assistance with valve configurations and
variations not covered in this manual.
Block valves are often used under safety valves
to isolate them when maintenance is required.
When putting the safety valve in service be sure
the block valve is fully opened. If the block valve
is opened after system start-up, the safety
valve may briefly vent before the volume on the
larger area side of the piston gets pressurized
to close the main valve seat disk.

2 MAIN VALVE MAINTENANCE
2.1 Disassembly
Before beginning disassembly, bleed off any
pressure trapped in the main valve or pilot.
Refer to Figure 1 for parts description and
location.
Remove the cap (Item 17) from the body
(Item 1). Remove the liner seal (Item 6), liner
(Item 5) and piston (Item 10). Remove the soft
goods from the piston. If the piston is equipped
with a wedge ring (Item 23), clean and retain
it for use during assembly. The dipper tube
(Item 4) is swaged in place and no attempt
should be made to remove it. The nozzle
(Item 3) should not be removed unless it is
damaged or the nozzle seal (Item 2) is leaking.
Refer to Figure 1 for parts description and
location.
Note: do not remove lock pin and lift stop
adjusting bolt (Items 12 and 11) on valves so
equipped unless nozzle is removed. This bolt
controls the piston lift and the valve’s relieving
capacity. If either or both the nozzle and lift bolt
were removed, then lift must be reset following
the procedure of paragraph 2.3.3.
2.1.1 Nozzle and nozzle seal disassembly
Refer to Figure 2 for parts description and
location.
1. Remove lock pin and lift adjusting bolt from
piston, if applicable.
2. Place liner in body and piston, without seat
or seat retainer, into liner and on top of
nozzle.
3. Place appropriate spacer (see Table 1)
on top of piston and then the cap over
the spacer.

2.2 Main valve nozzle rework
Should the main valve nozzle seating face
become nicked or scratched such that the main
valve seat does not seal, the imperfections
can be removed by polishing the seating face
with 400 grit sandpaper. If necessary, the
nozzle may be removed from the body and
the nozzle seating face (only the seating face)
may be remachined and/or polished using
400 grit sandpaper on a flat surface plate. The
resurfaced nozzle must be within the limiting
dimensions shown in the Table and Figure
below. If the resurfaced seating face standoff is
less than the minimum projection height listed,
the nozzle must be replaced.
Minimum
projection
4. Thread the appropriate number of cap bolts
(see Table I) into threaded holes on top of
body. If two bolts are used, they should be
180° apart. When using four bolts, they
should be 90° apart. Always use the shortest
cap bolts supplied with the valve unless all
cap bolts are required. For example, the
1” Type 40/50 is equipped with two 1.50”
long bolts and two 1.88” long bolts but only
the two 1.50” long bolts should be used.
However, the 2” Type 40/50 is equipped with
two 1.25” long bolts and two 1.62” long bolts
and all four bolts are required for nozzle
installation.
5. Tighten cap bolts evenly to the torque listed
in Table I to compress nozzle seal.
6. Use a punch or bar with a light hammer
and tap on the nozzle retainer teeth to
loosen the nozzle retainer. Unthread nozzle
retainer approximately ½ turn.
7. Loosen cap bolts to remove load from
nozzle. Remove components from
main valve.

2.3.2 Soft goods and main valve reassembly
Refer to Figure 1 for parts description and
location.
2.3.3 Type XX3 piston and seat
Clean and apply a light coating of Dow Corning
No. 33 or equivalent silicone lubricant on all
threads. Install new seat and reassemble seat
retainer and seat retainer screw or screws.
Note: over tightening of seat retainer screw
or screws can distort or damage the seat and
cause leakage. Retainer screw or screws
should be installed until assembly is snug.
Then tighten an additional ¼ to ½ turn
to secure assembly.
On 1” thru 4” Type 43/53 and 1.5” thru 3” Type
63 valves, if either or both the nozzle and lift
bolt were removed, then lift needs to be set. If
lift setting gages are available, use lift setting
procedure 06.3349 (gas service) or 06.3350
(liquid service); otherwise use procedure
05.2284.
On 1" to 4" Type 40-RL (Special Restricted Lift.
This is different than Type 50 Restricted Lift)
valves, use lift setting procedure #1101-28214.
For gas service valves, install new piston seal
with new back-up ring in upper groove. The
back-up ring is assembled below the O-ring,
see Detail A. For liquid service valves, install
new piston seal along with original wedge ring
in lower groove. The wedge ring is assembled
below the O-ring, see Detail A. For gas service,
lubricate upper portion of liner I.D., piston seal,
and back-up ring with Dow Corning No. 33 or
equivalent. For liquid service, lubricate the
same area with Desco 600 or equivalent. Use
lubricant sparingly. Insert liner and piston into
body and install new liner seal.
Install the cap making sure it is seated squarely
into body. Install cap bolts hand tight then
tighten an additional ¼ to ½ turn uniformly so
as not to “cock” the cap. Such a condition may
result in leakage at the liner seal or cause the
piston and liner to bind.

PRESSURE RANGE
Refer to Figures 3, 4, and 5.
Arrange all parts in an orderly sequence
on a flat work surface during disassembly.
This will facilitate assembly and help ensure
that the correct parts are assembled in the
proper sequence.
3.1 Disassembly
Before beginning disassembly, bleed off any
pressure trapped in the main valve or pilot.
3.1.1 Standard pilot - gas or liquid
Note: if the pilot is equipped with a lift lever,
the lift lever handle assembly (Item 310) must
be unscrewed and removed from the cap
(Item 460) before continuing with disassembly.
To do this, hold the lift lever handle in the
position shown in Figure 3, unscrew the lift
assembly bushing from the cap, and remove
the handle assembly.
Clamp pilot assembly in vise with spring bonnet
(Item 50) up. Remove the cap (Item 460), for
pilot with lift lever remove jam nut (Item 350)
and lift lever nut (Item 340), loosen the
locknut (Item 290), and turn the pressure
adjustment screw (Item 270) counterclockwise
to remove the spring tension. Remove the
bonnet lock bolt (Item 60) and unscrew the
spring bonnet from the body (Item 10). The
spring (Item 160) and spring washers (Item 170)
will be loose in the bonnet. Use a ¼” wrench on
the flats to hold the upper end of the feedback
piston (Item 100) and remove the hex nut
(Item 260) and lockwasher (Item 180). Turn body
upside down while holding a hand under the top
to catch the sense piston (Item 110). Remove
the inlet bushing (Item 20). Remove any dirt
or debris in the screen assembly in the inlet
bushing. Turn body right side up over the bench
to catch parts. Push the feedback piston down
until all the internals come out the bottom.
The piston seal backup ring (Item 120), sense
seal (Item 190), feedback spacer (Item 130),
and feedback seal (Item 200) will remain in
the top of the body and must be removed.
3.1.2 Pilot accessories
For pilot with a field test assembly, Figure 5,
remove the field test backflow preventer from
the pilot body. Unscrew the bushing from the
backflow preventer body and remove the spring
and shuttle. Remove the field test indicator,
Figure 5, from the main valve dome port.
Unscrew the bushing from the indicator body
and remove the plunger and spring.
For pilot equipped with a main valve backflow
check valve, Figure 5, remove the backflow
preventer from main valve dome port or from
the field test indicator. Unscrew the bushing
from the backflow preventer body and remove
the spring and shuttle. Remove the pilot
exhaust backflow check valve from the pilot
exhaust port. Unscrew the fitting from the
backflow check valve body and remove the
flow washer and ball.
3.1.3
Remove and discard all old seats, seals
and O-rings before beginning assembly.
If a tool is used, take care not to damage the
body seal bore. The outlet nozzle seal (Item
230) may stay in the lower bore of the body and
must be removed. Pull the outlet nozzle (Item
30) off the bottom of the internal assembly and
remove the spool seal (Item 210). Examine the
seating surface of the outlet nozzle for nicks or
scratches. Small irregularities may be removed
by lightly lapping the outlet nozzle’s top face.
Clamp the internal assembly in the vise upside
down and remove the inlet nozzle (Item 40) by
inserting an approximately 3/16” diameter pin
punch in the hole and using it as a wrench. The
spool assembly will come out with the inlet
nozzle, leaving the spool spring (Item 150) free.
Clamp the spool nut (Item 90) in the vise upside
down and unscrew the inner spool (Item 70).
Disassemble the inlet nozzle, outer spool
(Item 80), and inner spool and remove all seals.
Examine the inlet nozzle the same as the
outlet nozzle.

• Insert this assembly into the pilot body with
the top of the feedback piston sticking out at
the top. Holding the bottom of the assembly
from below, insert the feedback seal onto the
feedback piston. Push it down all the way into
the gap between the feedback piston and the
pilot body until it bottoms out in the body. Use
appropriate end of the tool provided in the
kit. For AED pilot, when inserting the spring
energized PTFE seal, the spring end of the
feedback seal should face upward, toward
where the spacer will be installed.
• Insert spacer into pilot body after the
feedback seal. Using the installation tool,
push sense seal into the body. For AED
pilot, the spring end of the seal should face
the spacer.
• Push in the piston seal backup ring and then
the sense piston with the lip-end facing down.
• Place lock washer on sense piston and
then thread the hex nut hand-tight onto the
feedback piston.
• Turn the assembly over and place the outlet
nozzle seal in the shoulder in the pilot
body. Ensure it bottoms out and fits snug
in the body.
• Assemble the outlet nozzle inside the pilot
body with the raised center section end
going in first.
• Insert spool seal in the cavity between
the inner spool and outlet nozzle.
Push in the seal using the appropriate end of
the tool included in the kit, ensuring that the
seal bottoms out in the cavity. For the AED
pilot, install with the spring end of the seal
facing the bottom of the pilot body.
3.2 Assembly
3.2.1 Standard pilot - gas or liquid service
Pilot assembly steps are listed below and are
generally in the reverse order of disassembly.
Lightly lubricate elastomer O-rings with Dow
Corning Molykote No. 33 Silicone grease or
equivalent. Do not lubricate seats. Also do
not lubricate PTFE or PEEK parts (if used in
this valve). Lightly lubricate sliding surfaces,
straight threads and spring washer pivot
points with Dow Corning No. 33 Silicone
grease or equivalent, except as specified
below. If available, use Fluorolube LG-160
on straight threads.
Some steps below are specific to the AED
(Anti-Explosive Decompression resistant)
800 pilot, which uses some spring energized
Teflon seals as opposed to all elastomer seals.
• Clamp assembly facing down at hexagonal
section/flats at base (larger end) of feedback
piston in a vise. Using suitable spanner
wrench (C-spanner), or punch that was
used during disassembly, tighten assembly.
Be careful to not damage the radius at
the bottom of the inlet nozzle if using a
spanner wrench.

3.2.2 Pilot accessories
Assembly is done in reverse order of
disassembly.
For pilot with a field test assembly, lightly
lubricate the indicator bushing threads and all
seals with Dow Corning No. 33 Silicone grease
or equivalent. Lightly lubricate the field test
backflow preventer bushing threads and all
seals with Dow Corning No. 33 Silicone grease
or equivalent. When reinstalling the field test
backflow preventer on the pilot, orient it so that
the bushing end is connected to the supply tube
(process) side.
For pilot with a main valve backflow preventer
and pilot exhaust backflow check valve, lightly
lubricate the backflow preventer bushing
threads, the check valve fitting threads, and all
seals with Dow Corning No. 33 Silicone grease
or equivalent. When reinstalling the backflow
preventer in the main valve dome port or on the
field test indicator, orient it so that the bushing
end is connected to the pilot (process) side.
CAUTION
To avoid damaging any of the lift lever
components, do not rotate the lift lever handle
past that position where the cam surface of the
handle assembly first contacts the lower face of
the lift lever nut.
ANDERSON GREENWOOD SERIES 800 POSRV
INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE INSTRUCTIONS
Lift lever handle installation
For pilot equipped with a lift lever, install the
lift lever handle assembly (Item 310) after
completing the final pilot adjustment.
Screw the lift lever nut (Item 340) on the
threaded portion of the lift lever rod (Item 330)
until the lower face of the lift lever nut is
approximately 2.32” above the top of the lock
nut (Item 290). Use the jam nut (Item 350) to
lightly lock the lift lever nut in place. Screw
the cap on the set pressure adjustment screw
(Item 270) until it is hand tight against the lock
nut. The lower face of the lift lever nut should
be even with the center of the threaded hole
in the cap. If the lift lever nut is not positioned
correctly, remove the cap and adjust the nuts
as required, and reinstall the cap.
With the lift lever handle held in the position
shown in Figure 3, install the handle assembly
by screwing the handle assembly bushing
into the cap. The cam surface of the lift lever
handle assembly must contact the lower
face of the lift lever nut between 15° and 45°
of clockwise or counterclockwise rotation of
the handle past its null or centered position.
• Next, place the inlet bushing seal on
outlet nozzle.
• Thread inlet bushing onto pilot body and
hand-tighten. Place body in vise and fully
tighten bushing onto body.
• Flip the assembly in the vise right-side up.
Grip the wrench flat at the top of the feedback
piston and tighten the hex nut. Lubricate top
of the feedback piston.
• Place spring/ spring washers assembly
on feedback piston. For pilot with lift lever,
thread in the lift rod into the lower washer
prior to this step.
• Prior to assembling bonnet on pilot body,
lubricate threads on the body. If available,
especially for offshore applications,
apply Never-Seez NG-165 lubricant (part
number 05.1500.001).
Note: Never-Seez is not included in the kit.
• Tighten bonnet until hole in bonnet for the
lock bolt lines up with corresponding hole in
body. Thread the bonnet lock bolt and tighten.
As before, use Never-Seez if available.
• Lubricate the round end of the pressure
set screw. Lubricate the set screw thread
(use Never-Seez if available). Thread it into
the bonnet. Thread the lock nut onto the
set screw.
• Set and test the pilot per section 4.
• Thread the cap over the set screw. For pilots
with lift levers, follow the procedure below.
Resistance of the handle indicates contact has
occurred. If resistance occurs at less than 15°,
the lift lever nut must be positioned higher.
If resistance first occurs at more than 45°,
the nut must be positioned lower on the lift
lever rod.
If necessary, remove the handle assembly
from the cap following the procedure of
paragraph 3.1 and repeat this assembly
procedure in order to correctly position the lift
lever nut and jam nut on the threaded portion
of the lift lever rod. When correctly positioned
lock the lift lever nut with the jam nut, install
and securely tighten the cap, install the handle
assembly, and securely tighten the handle
assembly bushing.

4 PILOT SET PRESSURE ADJUSTMENT
4.1 Definitions
Set pressure is defined as the supply pressure
at which the dome pressure is 70% of the
supply pressure. This corresponds to the initial
audible discharge of gas or first steady stream
of liquid from the main valves.
Crack pressure is defined as the supply
pressure at which gas flow begins at the pilot
exhaust.
Reseat pressure is defined as the supply
pressure at which the dome pressure increases
to 75% of supply pressure. The dome pressure
will continue to increase until the supply
pressure decreases to 95% of set.
4.2 Set pressure
4.2.1 Gas service pilot
To adjust the set pressure, a test set-up similar
to that shown in Figure 6 should be used. The
test media should be air. The adjustment screw
should be turned IN most of the way. Increase
the supply pressure to nameplate setting and
slowly back out the adjustment screw until
flow through the pilot exhaust begins. Continue
to slowly back out the adjustment screw until
dome pressure is 70% of the supply pressure
and the supply pressure meets the required
set pressure tolerance of paragraph 4.4. After
adjustment is completed, securely tighten the
jam nut.
To determine reseat pressure, shut off the air
supply and use the accumulator vent valve to
slowly reduce the supply pressure until the
dome pressure is 75% of supply pressure.
Close the shut-off valve and slowly open the
bleed valve. When the dome pressure gauge
reading is zero, the pilot may be removed
from the test set-up.
4.2.2 Liquid service pilot
Note: for liquid service pilots, set pressure
must be verified on liquid. An initial set
pressure adjustment may be made with air
as the supply pressure media using a test
set-up similar to that shown in Figure 6 and
following the procedure described in paragraph
4.2.1 above. This initial set pressure will be
approximately 1½% lower than the set pressure
observed when the pilot is tested on liquid.
To adjust the set pressure, a test set-up similar
to that shown in Figure 7 should be used. The
test media should be water. Some air volume
must be maintained above the water surface
in the accumulator.
Increase the air supply pressure to nameplate
setting and slowly back out the adjustment
screw until water flow through the pilot
exhaust begins. Continue to slowly back out the
adjustment screw until dome pressure is 70%
of the supply pressure and the supply pressure
meets the required set pressure tolerance of
paragraph 4.4.
To determine reseat pressure, shut off the air
supply and use the accumulator vent valve to
slowly reduce supply pressure until the dome
pressure is 75% of supply pressure.
Close the shut-off valve in the water line to
the pilot inlet port and slowly open the bleed
valve. When the dome pressure gauge reading
is zero, the pilot may be removed from the test
set-up.
The optional indicator assembly shown in
Figure 7 may be used for set pressure above
70 psig. If an indicator assembly is used,
slowly increase the supply pressure until the
indicator pin pulls into the indicator assembly
and is approximately flush with the end of the
indicator body. The pressure when the pin pulls
in is the set pressure. Loosen the jam nut,
adjust the adjustment screw, and retighten the
jam nut as required to meet the set pressure
tolerance of paragraph 4.4.
Shut off the air supply and use the accumulator
vent valve to slowly bleed down supply pressure
until the indicator pin “pops” out of the
indicator assembly (full extension of the pin is
approximately 7/16”). The pressure when the pin
“pops” out is the reseat pressure.
Close the shut-off valve in the water line to
the pilot inlet port and slowly open the bleed
valve. When the dome pressure gauge reading
is zero, the pilot may be removed from the
test set-up.

5 VALVE ASSEMBLY TESTING
5.1 General
The complete valve assembly should be tested
for internal and external leakage and to verify
set pressure using a test set-up similar to
that shown in Figure 8, 9 or 10. The test media
should be air.
CAUTION
Do not test liquid service valves using water or
other liquid test media. Liquid service valves
should be tested using air as the test media in
accordance with the procedures described below.
Testing fully assembled liquid service valves
using air ensures that no water or other liquid
will remain in the main valve dome after final
valve testing.
5.2 Low pressure leakage check
5.2.1 Valve for gas service
Slowly increase the supply pressure to 30%
of set pressure. Check for main valve nozzle,
seat, and piston seal leakage at the main valve
outlet. To help in seating the valve seat and
piston seal, the valve may be actuated several
times. No leakage shall occur in 15 seconds.
5.2.2 Valve for liquid service
Slowly increase supply pressure to 30% of set
pressure. Check for main valve nozzle, seat,
and piston seal leakage at the main valve
outlet. To help in seating the valve seat and
piston seal, the valve may be actuated several
times. No leakage shall occur in 15 seconds.
If leakage is detected at the valve outlet, note
the leakage in bubbles observed in 15 seconds
and remove the leakage test device from the
outlet flange. With the same supply pressure
applied to the valve inlet, use a bubble test leak
detector to measure leakage through the pilot
exhaust. Low pressure leakage performance
is acceptable if the leakage at the main valve
outlet is equal to the pilot exhaust leakage and
this leakage value does not exceed 15 bubbles
in 15 seconds.
5.3 High pressure leakage check
5.3.1 Valve for gas service
Apply supply pressure to the inlet equal to 90%
of the set pressure. Check for leakage at the
main valve outlet. Using a suitable gas and air
leak detector solution, check for leakage at the
cap seal and other pressure connections. No
leakage shall occur at the valve outlet and no
visible leakage shall be detected at the cap seal
or other pressure connections in one minute.
5.3.2 Valve for liquid service
Apply supply pressure to the inlet equal to 90%
of the set pressure. Check for leakage at the
main valve outlet. Using a suitable gas and air
leak detector solution, check for leakage at the
cap seal and other pressure connections. No
leakage shall occur at the valve outlet and no
visible leakage shall be detected at the cap seal
or other pressure connections in one minute.
If leakage is detected at the valve outlet, note
the leakage in bubbles observed in one minute
and remove the leakage test device from the
outlet flange. With the same supply pressure
applied to the valve inlet use a bubble test leak
detector to measure leakage through the pilot
exhaust. High pressure leakage performance
is acceptable if the leakage at the main valve
outlet is equal to the pilot exhaust leakage and
this leakage value does not exceed 60 bubbles
in one minute.
Where superimposed back pressure is
specified, the downstream or exhaust
connections which are exposed to the back
pressure shall be tested at 1.5 times the
specified back pressure and all mechanical
connections so pressurized will be checked
for leaks. No visible leakage shall occur in
one minute using a suitable gas and air leak
detector solution.

5.4 Main valve function check
CAUTION
This test must be performed at a slow rate of
pressure increase to ensure that the main valve
does not go into full lift. The pressure applied
to the inlet is not to exceed 105% of nameplate
set pressure.
After completing the high pressure leakage
check of paragraph 5.3, verify main valve
opening as follows. Remove the leakage test
device from the outlet flange. Slowly increase
the inlet pressure above 90% of set pressure.
Continue increasing inlet pressure until an
audible discharge at the valve outlet verifies
main valve opening.

6 PILOT SET PRESSURE FIELD TEST
PROCEDURE
6.1 General
The set pressure of valves equipped with field
test accessory can be checked with the valve
installed, in service, using a test set up similar
to that shown in Figure 10. This procedure
accurately checks the set pressure. For slow
rates of test gas pressure increase, this
procedure will also check the reseat pressure.
The main valve will not open if the process
pressure is less than set pressure. If the main
must be opened, slowly increase the test gas
pressure until the main valve opens. To close
the main valve, close block valve “A” on the test
gas bottle and open vent valve “C”.
6.2 Procedure
A. Remove plug from field test fitting and
connect flex hose from test gas bottle.
B. Close vent valve “C” on gas bottle, open
block valve “A” to slowly pressurize pilot and
observe test pressure gage. Set pressure is
reached when the pressure gage shows a
rapid reduction in pressure. Close valve “A”
then open slowly to recycle the pilot enough
to be certain of the set pressure.
C. To remove set up, close block valve “A”,
open vent valve “C”, remove flexible hose
from field test fitting and install plug on field
test fitting.
