Introduction
Scope of the Manual
This manual provides instructions and parts lists for
67C Series Instrument Supply Regulators. Instructions and
parts lists for other equipment mentioned in this instruction
manual, as well as for other 67C Series Regulators, are
found in separate manuals.
Product Descriptions
The 67C Series Direct-Operated Regulators are typically
used to provide constantly controlled, reduced pressures
to pneumatic and electro-pneumatic controllers and
other instruments. They are suitable for most air or gas
applications. Other applications include providing reduced
pressures to air chucks, air jets and spray guns.
• The Types 67C and 67CS are the standard instrument
supply regulators without a filter or internal relief.
• The Types 67CF and 67CFS are equipped with a filter for
removing particles from the supply gas.
• The Types 67CR and 67CSR have an internal relief
valve with a soft seat for reliable shutoff with no
discernible leakage.
• The Types 67CFR and 67CFSR have a filter and internal
relief valve with a soft seat for reliable shutoff with no
discernible leakage.
Principle of Operation
Downstream pressure is registered internally on the lower
side of the diaphragm. When the downstream pressure is
at or above the set pressure, the valve plug is held against
the orifice and there is no flow through the regulator. When
demand increases, downstream pressure drops slightly
allowing the spring to extend, moving the stem down
and the valve plug away from the orifice. This allows flow
through the regulator.

Internal Relief (Types 67CR, 67CSR, 67CFR
and 67CFSR)
If for some reason, outside of normal operating conditions,
the downstream pressure exceeds the setpoint of the
regulator, the force created by the downstream pressure
will lift the diaphragm until the diaphragm is lifted off the
relief seat. This allows flow through the token relief. The
relief valve on the Type 67CR, 67CSR, 67CFR or 67CFSR
is an elastomer plug that prevents leakage of air from the
downstream to atmosphere during normal operation, thereby
conserving plant air.
Smart Bleed
™ Airset
Recommended for fail-safe actuators, no bleed applications
and dead-end service.
In some cases, it is desired to exhaust downstream
pressure if inlet pressure is lost or drops below the
setpoint of the regulator. For example, if the regulator is
installed on equipment that at times has no flow demand
but is expected to backflow on loss of inlet pressure.
The Types 67CFR and 67CFSR can be ordered with the
Smart Bleed option which includes an integrated soft
seat check valve. During operation, if inlet pressure is
lost or decreases below the setpoint of the regulator, the
downstream pressure will back flow upstream through the
regulator and check valve.
This option eliminates the need for a fixed bleed downstream
of the regulator, thereby conserving plant air. In addition, the
soft seat feature of the check valve eliminates leakage while
the airset is in the lock-up position, preventing pressure
build-up that could trip safety loop functions on valves.
Overpressure Protection
The 67C Series Regulators have maximum outlet pressure
ratings that are lower than their maximum inlet pressure
ratings. A pressure relieving or pressure limiting device is
needed if inlet pressure can exceed the maximum outlet
pressure rating.
Types 67CR, 67CSR, 67CFR and 67CFSR have a low
capacity internal relief valve for minor seat leakage only.
Other overpressure protection must be provided if the
maximum inlet pressure can exceed the maximum pressure
rating of the downstream equipment or exceeds the
maximum outlet pressure rating of the regulator.

Installation
Note
If the regulator is shipped mounted on
another unit, install that unit according to the
appropriate Instruction Manual.
▲ WARNING
Personal injury, property damage, equipment
damage or leakage due to escaping gas or
bursting of pressure-containing parts may
result if this regulator is overpressured or
is installed where service conditions could
exceed the limits given in the Specifications
section or where conditions exceed any
ratings of the adjacent piping or piping
connections. To avoid such injury or
damage, provide pressure-relieving or
pressure-limiting devices (as required by the
appropriate code, regulation or standard) to
prevent service conditions from exceeding
those limits.
The internal relief valve of the Type 67CR,
67CSR, 67CFR or 67CFSR does not provide
full overpressure protection. The internal
relief valve is designed for minor seat
leakage only. If maximum inlet pressure to
the regulator exceeds maximum pressure
ratings of the downstream equipment or
exceeds maximum allowable outlet pressure
of the regulator, additional overpressure
protection is required.
A regulator may vent some gas to the
atmosphere. In hazardous or flammable gas
service, vented gas may accumulate and
cause personal injury, death or property
damage due to fire or explosion. Vent a
regulator in hazardous gas service to a
remote, safe location away from air intakes
or any hazardous area. The vent line or
stack opening must be protected against
condensation or clogging.
Before installing a Type 67C, 67CR, 67CS, 67CSR,
67CF, 67CFR, 67CFS or 67CFSR Regulator, be sure the
installation complies with the following installation guidelines:
1. Regulator operation within ratings does not preclude
the possibility of damage from debris in the lines
or from external sources. Regulators should be
inspected for damage periodically and after any
overpressure condition.
2. Only personnel qualified through training and
experience should install, operate and maintain a
regulator. Make sure that there is no damage to or
foreign material in the regulator. Also ensure that all
tubing and piping is free of debris.
3. Install the regulator so that flow is from the IN to the OUT
connection as marked on the regulator body.
4. For best drainage, orient the drain valve (key 2) to
the lowest possible point on the dripwell (key 5). This
orientation may be improved by rotating the dripwell with
respect to the body (key 1).
5. A clogged spring case vent hole may cause the
regulator to function improperly. To keep this vent hole
from being plugged (and to keep the spring case from
collecting moisture, corrosive chemicals or other foreign
material), orient the vent to the lowest possible point on
the spring case or otherwise protect it.
Inconel ® is a mark owned by Special Metals Corporation.
5
67C Series
Inspect the vent hole regularly to make sure it is not
plugged. Spring case vent hole orientation may be
changed by rotating the spring case with respect to
the body. A 1/4 NPT spring case vent may be remotely
vented by installing obstruction-free tubing or piping
into the vent. Protect the remote vent by installing a
screened vent cap on the remote end of the vent pipe.
6. For use in regulator shutdown, install upstream block
and vent valves and downstream block and vent
valves (if required) or provide some other suitable
means of properly venting the regulator inlet and
outlet pressures. Install a pressure gauge to monitor
instruments on startup.
7. Apply a good grade of pipe compound to the external pipe
threads before making connections, making sure not to get
the pipe compound inside the regulator.
8. Install tubing fitting or piping into the 1/4 NPT inlet
connection on the body (key 1) and into the 1/4 NPT
body outlet connection.
9. The second 1/4 NPT outlet can be used for a gauge or
other use. If not used, it must be plugged.
Installing a 67CF Series Regulator in an
Existing Installation
When installing a 67CF Series Regulator in an existing
installation, it may be necessary to use spacers
(key 34, Figure 13) to adapt the installation. If the mounting
bolts are too long, place a spacer on the bolt (see Figure 13).
To be sure the regulator is secure, the bolts should have at
least two full threads of engagement.
Startup and Adjustment
Key numbers are referenced in Figures 3 through 9.
1. With proper installation completed and
downstream equipment properly adjusted, slowly
open the upstream and downstream shutoff valve
(when used) while using pressure gauges to
monitor pressure.
▲ WARNING
To avoid personal injury, property damage
or equipment damage caused by bursting
of pressure containing parts or explosion of
accumulated gas, never adjust the control
spring to produce an outlet pressure higher
than the upper limit of the outlet pressure
range for that particular spring. If the desired
outlet pressure is not within the range of the
control spring, install a spring of the proper
range according to the diaphragm parts
maintenance procedure.
2. If outlet pressure adjustment is necessary, monitor
outlet pressure with a gauge during the adjustment
procedure. The regulator is adjusted by loosening
the locknut (key 18), if used, and turning the adjusting
screw or handwheel (key 19) clockwise to increase
or counterclockwise to decrease the outlet pressure
setting. Retighten the locknut to maintain the
adjustment position.
Shutdown
First, close the nearest upstream block valve and then
close the nearest downstream block valve (when used).
Next, open the downstream vent valve. Since the regulator
remains open in response to the decreasing downstream
pressure, pressure between the closed block valves will be
released through the open vent valve.
Maintenance
Regulator parts are subject to normal wear and must be
inspected and replaced as necessary. The frequency of
inspection and replacement of parts depends on the severity
of service conditions and applicable codes and government
regulations. Open the Type 67CF, 67CFR, 67CFS or
67CFSR drain valve (key 2) regularly to empty accumulated
liquid from the dripwell (key 5).
Note
If sufficient clearance exists, the body (key 1)
may remain mounted on other equipment or
in a line or panel during maintenance unless
the entire regulator will be replaced.
▲ WARNING
To avoid personal injury, property damage
or equipment damage caused by sudden
release of pressure or explosion of
accumulated gas, do not attempt any
maintenance or disassembly without first
isolating the regulator from system pressure
and relieving all internal pressure from
the regulator.
