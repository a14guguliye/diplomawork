1 GENERAL VALVE DESCRIPTION AND
START-UP
1.1 General
The Anderson Greenwood Series 400 valve is
designed for modulating action. The main valve
will open at nameplate set, but only an amount
proportional to the relieving capacity required.
As process pressure increases, the valve will
open more and be in full lift at 110% of set.
The main valve uses the principle of
pressurizing the top or large area of a
differential area piston with line pressure
to hold the piston closed up to set
pressure. At set pressure, the pilot relieves,
depressurizing the volume above the piston,
the main valve dome, and the piston lifts
permitting discharge from the main valve.
1.2 Installation
Either or both inlet and outlet may be
standard ANSI flanges or ANSI pipe threaded
connections and are to be installed in
accordance with accepted piping practices.
When remote pressure pick-up is used the pilot
supply tube is connected to a remote location
rather than to the inlet neck of the valve.
A block valve in the remote pilot supply line is
not recommended. If one is used it must be
opened before pressurizing the main valve.
For valves supplied with eyebolts, follow
the instructions in Anderson Greenwood
Pilot operated safety relief valves
05-9040-352 (VCOSI-06034 Operating and
Safety Instructions) pertaining to the safe use
and storage of eyebolts.
Refer to Anderson Greenwood Pilot operated
safety relief valves 05-9040-372 (VCIOM-03099
Winterization Guidelines) and 05-9040-352
for more information regarding Winterization
requirements.
NOTE
Remote pressure pick-up piping must have the
equivalent flow area of ⅜” tubing for lengths up to
100 feet. For lengths greater than this, consult factory.
1.3 Start-up
There must be pressure at the valve inlet or at
the pilot inlet/sense port for valves with remote
sense to establish a differential force across
the piston and ‘load’ it in the closed position.
Pressure must pass through the pilot and exert
force on the top of the piston. On normal plant
start-up the valve will close itself as pressure
increases.
Block valves are often used under safety valves
to isolate them when maintenance is required.
When putting the safety valve in service be sure
the block valve is fully opened. If the block valve
is opened after system start-up, the safety
valve may briefly vent before the dome gets
pressurized to close the main valve seat.
Before installation, these instructions must be carefully read and understood.

As capacity relief of the system is satisfied,
system pressure will begin to decrease. When
it does, the pilot will actuate and direct system
pressure to the main valve dome. This closes
the main valve.
The pilot is the non-flowing type. With the main
valve open and relieving at steady pressure,
no process gas or fluid flows through the pilot.
When process pressure changes, the pilot
actuates to change the lift of the main valve
piston. During these actuations a small amount
of gas or fluid from the main valve dome flows
through the pilot and is discharged thru the
pilot exhaust.
The set pressure range is 100 psig to 1480 psig.

2 MAIN VALVE MAINTENANCE
2.1 Disassembly
Before beginning disassembly, bleed off any
pressure trapped in the main valve or pilot.
Refer to Figure 1A (piston/seat Type XX3) and
Figure 1B (piston/seat Type XX9) for parts
description and location.
Remove cap (Item 17) from the body (Item 1).
Remove the liner seal (Item 6), liner (Item 5)
and piston (Item 10). Remove the soft goods
from the piston. If the piston is equipped with
a wedge ring (Item 23), clean and retain for
use during assembly. The dipper tube (Item 4)
is swaged in place and no attempt should be
made to remove it. The nozzle (Item 3) should
not be removed unless it is damaged or the
nozzle seal (Item 2) is leaking.
2.1.1 Nozzle and nozzle seal disassembly
Refer to Figure 2 for parts description and
location.
1. Remove lock pin and lift adjusting bolt from
piston, if applicable.
2. Place liner in body and piston, without seat
or seat retainer, into liner and on top of
nozzle.
3. Place appropriate spacer (see Table I) on top
of piston and then the cap over the spacer.
4. Thread the appropriate number of cap bolts
(see Table I) into threaded holes on top of
body. If two bolts are used, they should be
180° apart. When using four bolts, they
should be 90° apart. Always use the shortest
cap bolts supplied with the valve unless
all cap bolts are required. For example,
the 1” Type 40/50 is equipped with two 1.50”
long bolts and two 1.88” long bolts but only
the two 1.50” long bolts should be used.
However, the 2” Type 40/50 is equipped with
two 1.25” long bolts and two 1.62” long bolts
and all four bolts are required for nozzle
installation.
5. Tighten cap bolts evenly to the torque listed
in Table I to compress nozzle seal.
6. Use a punch or bar with a light hammer
and tap on the nozzle retainer teeth to
loosen the nozzle retainer. Unthread nozzle
retainer approximately ½ turn.
7. Loosen cap bolts to remove load from nozzle.
Remove components from main valve.

2.2 Main valve nozzle rework
Should the main valve nozzle seating face
become nicked or scratched such that the main
valve seat does not seal, the imperfections
can be removed by polishing the seating face
with 400 grit sandpaper. If necessary, the
nozzle may be removed from the body and
the nozzle seating face (only the seating face)
may be remachined and/or polished using
400 grit sandpaper on a flat surface plate. The
resurfaced nozzle must be within the limiting
dimensions shown in the table and figure
below. If the resurfaced seating face standoff is
less than the minimum projection height listed,
the nozzle must be replaced.

1.4 Maintenance
Anderson Greenwood recommended main valve
and pilot maintenance procedures including
pilot set pressure adjustment and valve
assembly testing are described in the following
paragraphs. Following these procedures in
a regular pressure relief valve maintenance
program appropriate for the specific operating
conditions will ensure satisfactory valve
performance and provide optimum service life.
Should the pressure/media requirements of a
pilot operated pressure relief valve be outside
the capabilities of the repair facility, contact
Anderson Greenwood for specific instructions
before starting any maintenance activity.
This manual is provided as a general guide for
the maintenance of the safety valves described
herein. It does not include procedures
covering all valve configurations and variations
manufactured by Anderson Greenwood. The
user is advised to contact Anderson Greenwood
or one of our authorized representatives for
assistance with valve configurations and
variations not covered in this manual.
NOTE
Do not remove lock pin and lift adjusting bolt (Items 11
and 12) on valves so equipped unless nozzle is
removed. This bolt controls the piston lift and hence
the valve’s relieving capacity. If either or both the
nozzle and lift bolt were removed, then lift must be
reset following the procedure of paragraph 2.3.3
(Type XX3 or paragraph 2.3.4 (Type XX9).

2.3.2 Soft goods installation and main valve
reassembly
Refer to Figure 1A (piston/seat Type XX3) and
Figure 1B (piston/seat Type XX9) for parts
description and location.
2.3.3 Type XX3 piston and seat
Clean and apply a light coating of Dow Corning
No. 33 or equivalent silicone lubricant on all
threads. Install new seat and reassemble seat
retainer and seat retainer screw or screws.
NOTE
Over tightening of seat retainer screw or screws
can distort or damage the seat and cause leakage.
Retainer screw or screws should be installed until
assembly is snug. Then tighten an additional ¼ to ½
turn to secure assembly.
On 1” to 4” Type 43/53 and 1.5” to 3” Type 63
valves, if either or both the nozzle and lift bolt
were removed, then lift needs to be set. If lift
setting gages are available, use lift setting
procedure 06.3349 (gas service) or 06.3350
(liquid service); otherwise use procedure
05.2284.
On 1" to 4" Type 40-RL (Special Restricted Lift.
This is different than Type 50 Restricted Lift)
valves, use lift setting procedure #1101-28214.
Install new piston seal along with original
wedge ring (if so equipped). Lubricate upper
portion of liner I.D., piston seal, and wedge
ring (if present) with Dow Corning No. 33 or
equivalent for all gas service valves and for
liquid service valves with set pressure below
275 psig. Liquid service valves with set pressure
at 275 psig and above use Desco 600 or
equivalent. Use lubricant sparingly. Insert liner
and piston into body and install new liner seal.
Install the cap making sure it is seated squarely
into body. Torque cap bolts uniformly so as not
to ‘cock’ cap. Such a condition may result in
leakage at the liner seal or cause the piston

Refer to Figures 3, 4, and 5.
Arrange all parts in an orderly sequence on
a flat work surface during disassembly. This
will facilitate assembly and help ensure that
the correct parts are assembled in the proper
sequence.
3.1 Disassembly
Before beginning disassembly, bleed off any
pressure trapped in the main valve or pilot.
3.1.1 Standard pilot – gas or liquid service
NOTE
If the pilot is equipped with a lift lever, the lift lever
handle assembly (Item 42) must be removed from the
cap (Item 17) before continuing with disassembly. To
do this, hold the lift lever handle in the position shown
in Figure 3, unscrew the handle assembly bushing
(Item 43) from the cap, and remove the handle
assembly.
Remove the cap (Item 17), for pilot with lift
lever remove jam nut (Item 44) and lift lever
nut (Item 45), loosen the jam nut (Item 16),
and turn the adjustment screw (Item 15)
counterclockwise to relieve the spring tension.
Exercise caution when removing the spring
bonnet (Item 14) from pilots set above 500 psig,
as spring tension is not completely relieved
until the bonnet is removed. Remove the spring
bonnet, spring (Item 6), and spring washers
(Item 13).
Lift the piston plate (Item 4) with internal parts
attached upward and remove from the body
(Item 1). Unscrew the piston nut (Item 9) from
the feedback piston (Item 3) and remove the
lock washer (Item 36). Disassemble the sense
piston (Item 10) and feedback piston from the
piston plate. Unscrew the inlet nozzle (Item 5)
from the feedback piston. Remove the spool
spring (Item 8) and inlet nozzle with the spool
from the feedback piston.
Remove the bias spring (Item 11) and body
plug (Item 2) from the body. Using a hex key
(Allen wrench) inserted through the bottom
of the body into the hex socket in the outlet
nozzle (Item 25), unscrew the outlet nozzle and
remove it through the top of the body. Note
that when viewed from the bottom of the body,
the hex key is turned clockwise to unscrew the
outlet nozzle.
3.1.2 Iso-Dome pilot – gas service
NOTE
All Iso-Dome pilots are gas service pilots; however,
fully assembled valves with these pilots may be either
gas service valves or liquid services valves.
After bleeding off any pressure trapped in the
main valve or pilot, remove the pilot with the
regulator (Item 55) attached from the main
valve. Unscrew and remove bracket bolts
(Items 52) and bracket bolts (Items 53). Slide
the bracket (Item 49) outward approximately
1½” along the regulator cover spacer (Item 50).
Using an 11/16” wrench, unscrew the adapter
(Item 48) with regulator attached from the body
(Item 1). If necessary, slide the bracket farther
out along the cover spacer so that it does not
hit the body. Support the regulator during
this operation in order to avoid damaging the
adapter threads or the body threads. Loosen
set screw (Item 54) and remove regulator cover
cap (Item 51), regulator cover spaces (Item 50),
and bracket.
Continue pilot disassembly in accordance with
the procedures described in paragraph 3.1.1
except that the Iso-Dome pilot uses an adapter
in place of the body plug (Item 2) in a standard
pilot.
3.1.3 Iso-Sense pilot – gas or liquid service
The Iso-Sense pilot sectional drawing shown in
Figure 3 is presented for identification purposes
only. This is a special pilot assembly which may
incorporate non-standard components. Contact
Anderson Greenwood for replacement parts
and maintenance instructions for individual
pilots (serial number is required for complete
identification).

3.1.4 Pilot variations and accessories
For pilot equipped with a one-piece spool, Figure 3
Style A, remove the spool seal (Item 28) and the
outlet seat (Item 30) from the spool (Item 31; then
remove the spool from the inlet nozzle.
For pilot equipped with a three-piece spool,
Figure 3 Style E, unscrew the spool nut (Item 39)
from the inner spool (Item 41), remove the
outer spool (Item 40) from the inlet nozzle and
remove the inner spool from the outer spool.
For pilot equipped with a field test accessory,
Figure 4, remove this accessory with the shuttle
from the body (Item 1). Disassemble the dome
connector from the field test body and remove
the spring, plunger, and shuttle.
For pilot equipped with a backflow preventer
and pilot exhaust backflow check valve, Figure 5,
remove these accessories from main valve
dome port (backflow preventer) and the pilot
exhaust port (backflow check valve). Unscrew
the backflow preventer bushing from the body
and remove the shuttle. Unscrew the fitting
from the backflow check valve body and remove
the flow washer and ball.
Remove and discard all old seats, seals, and
O-rings before beginning assembly.
3.2 Assembly
3.2.1 Standard pilot – gas or liquid service
Assembly is done in the reverse order of
disassembly. Lightly lubricate all O-rings, all
sliding surfaces, screw threads and spring
washer pivot points with Dow Corning No. 33
Silicone grease or equivalent. Do not lubricate
the inlet seat (Item 7) or the outlet seat (Item 30).
For pilot with lift lever, do not install lift lever
handle assembly (Item 42) until final pilot
adjustment is completed, see paragraph 4.6.
Pilot assembly and pretest
When assembling piston plate with attached
internal parts subassembly to body
subassembly, orient hole in plate to fit over the
length of damper bushing (Item 38) projecting
past the body face. Engage spool in outlet
nozzle and press gently until assembly drops
in place.
Pretest to verify proper feedback piston
function by depressing piston stack assembly
downward. The bias spring should return
the stack assembly to the upward position.
If the stack assembly does not return, identify
and correct source of malfunction before
completing assembly.
3.2.2 Iso-Dome pilot – gas service
All Iso-Dome pilots are gas service pilots
(see Note paragraph 3.1.2).
Assemble pilot in accordance with procedures
described in paragraph 3.2.1. Support the
regulator when threading the adapter (Item 48)
with regulator attached into the body (Item 1).
With an 11/16” wrench used to back-up the
adapter, the regulator may be rotated ± ¼ turn
about the adapter axis to align the bracket
(Item 49) mounting surfaces on the body and
the regulator bracket (Item 56).
If alignment can not be achieved with ± ¼ turn,
unthread the regulator from the adapter. Clean
the ¼ NPT threads on the adapter and in the
regulator outlet port and wrap the adapter
threads with several wraps of PTFE thread seal
tape. Screw the regulator onto the adapter and
tighten sufficiently to effect a thread seal and
alignment of the bracket mounting surfaces.
Loosen the two #10-24 socket head cap screws
in the regulator bracket so that the bracket can
slide along the outside of the regulator. Install
the bracket and hand tighten two bracket
bolts (Item 52) into the body. Hand tighten
two bracket bolts (Item 53) into the regulator
bracket and securely tighten the two #10-24
socket head cap screws into the regulator
bracket.
Securely tighten the four bracket bolts. Do not
install the regulator cover spacer and regulator
cover cap until final adjustment is completed,
see paragraph 4.3.

4 PILOT ADJUSTMENT
4.1 Definitions
Set pressure is defined as the supply pressure
at which the dome pressure is 70% of the
supply pressure. This corresponds to the initial
audible discharge of gas or first steady stream
of liquid from the main valve.
Crack pressure is defined as the supply
pressure at which gas flow begins at the pilot
exhaust.
Reseat pressure is defined as the supply
pressure at which the dome pressure increases
to 75% of supply pressure. The dome pressure
will continue to increase until the supply
pressure decreases to 94% of set.
4.2 Set pressure, standard pilot
4.2.1 Gas service pilot
To adjust the set pressure, a test set-up similar
to that shown in Figure 6 should be used. The
test media should be air. The adjustment screw
should be turned IN most of the way. Increase
the supply pressure to nameplate setting and
slowly back out the adjustment screw until
flow through the pilot exhaust begins. Continue
to slowly back out the adjustment screw until
dome pressure is 70% of the supply pressure
and the supply pressure meets the required
set pressure tolerance of paragraph 4.5. After
adjustment is completed, securely tighten the
jam nut.
To determine reseat pressure, shut off the air
supply and use the accumulator vent valve to
slowly reduce the supply pressure until the
dome pressure is 75% of supply pressure.
Close the shut-off valve and slowly open the
bleed valve. When the dome pressure gauge
reading is zero, the pilot may be removed from
the test set-up.
4.2.2 Liquid service pilot
NOTE
An initial set pressure adjustment may be made with
air as the supply pressure media using a test set-up
similar to that shown in Figure 6 and following the
procedure described in paragraph 4.2.1 above. This
initial set pressure will be approximately 1½% lower
than the set pressure observed when the pilot is
tested on liquid.
To adjust the set pressure, a test set-up similar
to that shown in Figure 7 should be used. The
test media should be water. Some air volume
must be maintained above the water surface in
the accumulator.
Increase the air supply pressure to nameplate
setting and slowly back out the adjustment
screw until water flow through the pilot
exhaust begins. Continue to slowly back out the
adjustment screw until dome pressure is 70%
of the supply pressure and the supply pressure
meets the required set pressure tolerance of
paragraph 4.5.
To determine reseat pressure, shut off the air
supply and use the accumulator vent valve to
slowly reduce supply pressure until the dome
pressure is 75% of supply pressure.
Close the shut-off valve in the water line to
the pilot inlet port and slowly open the bleed
valve. When the dome pressure gauge reading
is zero, the pilot may be removed from the test
set-up.
The optional indicator assembly shown in
Figure 7 may be used for set pressure above
70 psig. If an indicator assembly is used,
slowly increase the supply pressure until the
indicator pin pulls into the indicator assembly
and is approximately flush with the end of the
indicator body. The pressure when the pin pulls
in is the set pressure. Loosen the jam nut,
adjust the adjustment screw, and retighten the
jam nut as required to meet the set pressure
tolerance of paragraph 4.5.
Shut off the air supply and use the accumulator
vent valve to slowly bleed down supply
pressure until the indicator pin ‘pops’ out of the
indicator assembly (full extension of the pin is
approximately 7/16”). The pressure when the pin
‘pops’ out is the reseat pressure.
Close the shut-off valve in the water line to
the pilot inlet port and slowly open the bleed
valve. When the dome pressure gauge reading
is zero, the pilot may be removed from the test
set-up.

4.3 Set pressure, Iso-Dome pilot
NOTE
All Iso-Dome pilots are gas service pilots
(See Note paragraph 3.1.2).
4.3.1 Gas sense pilot
To adjust set pressure, a test set-up similar to
that shown in Figure 8 should be used. The air
supply to the regulator inlet should be adjusted
so that the dome pressure gauge reading is 92%
± 2% of nameplate set pressure. The pressure at
the regulator inlet should be a minimum of 200
psi greater than the specified dome pressure. The
adjustment screw should be turned IN most of
the way. Generally it is not necessary to perform
any service work on the regulator; however, if
maintenance or repair is indicated, contact the
regulator manufacturer for instructions and
parts. The regulator output pressure should be
adjusted if service was performed on the regulator
or the pilot set pressure is being changed. Apply
pressure to the regulator inlet port of 200 psi
greater than the specified dome pressure. Using
a ½” open end wrench, turn the regulator
adjusting screw, clockwise rotation increases
and counterclockwise rotation decreases
output pressure, as required to produce a dome
pressure gauge reading equal to 92% ± 2% of the
specified pilot set pressure. Final adjustment
should be made in the increasing pressure
direction (with clockwise rotation). After final
adjustment is completed, install the regulator
cover spacer and the regulator cover cap. Adjust
regulator adjusting screw so that socket head set
screw in regulator cover cap will tighten against
the flat of the regulator adjusting screw. This may
require ± ¼ turn of regulator adjusting screw.
Securely tighten the socket head set screw to lock
the cover cap to the regulator adjusting screw.
WARNING
If regulator output pressure is set outside of the
92 ± 2% of nameplate set pressure limits, the
pilot (and the assembled valve) set pressure may
not comply with the tolerance requirements of
Section VIII and Section XIII of the ASME Boiler
and Pressure Vessel Code.
Increase the supply pressure to the nameplate
setting and slowly back out the adjustment
screw until flow through the pilot exhaust
begins. Continue to slowly back out the
adjustment screw until dome pressure is 70%
of the supply pressure. After adjustment is
completed, securely tighten the jam nut.
Close the block valve in the air supply line to
the accumulator, close the block valve in the air
supply line to the regulator, verify that the shutoff valve is open, slowly open the vent valve, and
slowly open the bleed valve. When the supply
pressure gauge and the dome pressure gauge
each read zero, the pilot may be removed from
the test set-up.
4.4 Range of adjustment
All pilots can be adjusted ± 5% beyond the
nameplate setting. If a set pressure change
is made that requires a new spring, consult
factory or refer to appropriate spring chart
in Anderson Greenwood report number
05.9065.017 to make proper selection.

INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE INSTRUCTIONS
4.3.2 Liquid sense pilot
To adjust the set pressure, a test set-up similar
to that shown in Figure 9 should be used.
The air supply to the regulator inlet should
be adjusted so that the dome pressure gauge
reading is 92% ± 2% of nameplate set pressure.
The pressure at the regulator inlet should be a
minimum of 200 psi greater than the specified
dome pressure. Generally it is not necessary
to perform any service work on the regulator;
however, if maintenance or repair is indicated,
contact the regulator manufacturer for
instructions and parts. If service was performed
on the regulator or if the pilot set pressure is
being changed, the regulator output pressure
should be adjusted following the procedure
described in paragraph 4.3.1.
Adjust the pilot set pressure in accordance with
procedure described in paragraph 4.2.2 except
no initial set pressure adjustment is made.
Close the block valve in the air supply line to
the accumulator, close the block valve in the air
supply line to the regulator, verify that the shutoff valve in the water line to the pilot is open,
slowly open the vent valve, and slowly open the
bleed valve. When the supply pressure gauge
and the dome gauge each read zero, the pilot
may be removed from the test set-up.

CAUTION
To avoid damaging any of the lift lever
components, do not rotate the lift lever handle
past that position where the cam surface of the
handle assembly first contacts the lower face of
the lift lever nut.
4.6 Lift lever handle assembly installation
For pilot equipped with a lift lever, install
the lift lever handle assembly (Item 42) after
completing the final pilot adjustment.
Screw the lift lever nut (Item 45) on the
threaded portion of the lift lever rod (Item 46)
until the lower face of the lift lever nut is
approximately 2 1/16” above the top of the spring
bonnet (Item 14). Use the jam nut (Item 44) to
lightly lock the lift lever nut in place. Screw the
cap on the threaded projection of the bonnet
insert (Item 37) until it is hand tight against
the spring bonnet. The lower face of the lift
lever nut should be even with the center of the
threaded hole in the cap. If the lift lever nut is
not positioned correctly, remove the cap and
adjust the nuts as required, and reinstall the cap.
With the lift lever handle held in the position
shown in Figure 3, install the handle assembly
by screwing the handle assembly bushing
(Item 43) into the cap. The cam surface of the
lift lever handle assembly must contact the
lower face of the lift lever nut between 15° and
45° of clockwise or counterclockwise rotation
of the handle past its null or centered position.
Resistance of the handle indicates contact has
occurred. If resistance occurs at less than 15°,
the lift lever nut must be positioned higher. If
resistance first occurs at more than 45°, the
nut must be positioned lower on the lift lever rod.
If necessary, remove the handle assembly from
the cap following the procedure of paragraph
3.1 and repeat this assembly procedure in order
to correctly position the lift lever nut and jam
nut on the threaded portion of the lift lever rod.
When correctly positioned lock the lift lever nut
with the jam nut, install and securely tighten the
cap, install the handle assembly, and securely
tighten the handle assembly bushing.

5 VALVE ASSEMBLY TESTING
5.1 General
The complete valve assembly should be tested
for internal and external leakage and to verify
set pressure using a test set-up similar to that
shown in Figures 10, 11, or 12. The test media
should be air.
CAUTION
Do not test liquid service valves using water or
other liquid test media. Liquid service valves
should be tested using air as the test media in
accordance with the procedures described below.
Testing fully assembled liquid service valves
using air ensures that no water or other liquid will
remain in the main valve dome after final valve
testing
5.2 Low pressure leakage check
NOTE
For valve with Iso-Dome pilot, apply regulator supply
pressure equal to a minimum of 200 psi greater than
92% of set pressure.
5.2.1 Valve for gas service or valve with
Iso-Dome pilot
Slowly increase the supply pressure to 30%
of set pressure. Check for main valve nozzle,
seat, and piston seal leakage at the main valve
outlet. To help in seating the valve seat and
piston seal, the valve may be actuated several
times. No leakage shall occur in 15 seconds.
5.2.2 Valve for liquid service
Slowly increase supply pressure to 30% of set
pressure. Check for main valve nozzle, seat,
and piston seal leakage at the main valve
outlet. To help in seating the valve seat and
piston seal, the valve may be actuated several
times. No leakage shall occur in 15 seconds.
If leakage is detected at the valve outlet, note
the leakage in bubbles observed in 15 seconds
and remove the leakage test device from the
outlet flange. With the same supply pressure
applied to the valve inlet, use a bubble test leak
detector to measure leakage through the pilot
exhaust. Low pressure leakage performance
is acceptable if the leakage at the main valve
outlet is equal to the pilot exhaust leakage and
this leakage value does not exceed 15 bubbles
in 15 seconds.
Liquid service valve with Iso-Dome pilot should
be tested per paragraph 5.2.1.
5.3 High pressure leakage check
NOTE
For valve with Iso-Dome pilot, apply regulator supply
pressure equal to a minimum of 200 psi greater than
92% of set pressure.
5.3.1 Valve for gas service or valve with Iso-Dome
pilot
Apply supply pressure to the inlet equal to 90%
of the set pressure. Check for leakage at the
main valve outlet. Using a suitable gas and air
leak detector solution, check for leakage at the
cap seal and other pressure connections. No
leakage shall occur at the valve outlet and no
visible leakage shall be detected at the cap seal
or other pressure connections in one minute.
5.3.2 Valve for liquid service
Apply supply pressure to the inlet equal to 90%
of the set pressure. Check for leakage at the
main valve outlet. Using a suitable gas and air
leak detector solution, check for leakage at the
cap seal and other pressure connections. No
leakage shall occur at the valve outlet and no
visible leakage shall be detected at the cap seal
or other pressure connections in one minute.
If leakage is detected at the valve outlet, note
the leakage in bubbles observed in one minute
and remove the leakage test device from the
outlet flange. With the same supply pressure
applied to the valve inlet use a bubble test leak
detector to measure leakage through the pilot
exhaust. High pressure leakage performance
is acceptable if the leakage at the main valve
outlet is equal to the pilot exhaust leakage and
this leakage value does not exceed 60 bubbles
in one minute.
Liquid service valve with Iso-Dome pilot to be
tested per paragraph 5.3.1.
Where superimposed back pressure is
specified, the downstream or exhaust
connections which are exposed to the back
pressure shall be tested at 1.5 times the
specified back pressure and all mechanical
connections so pressurized will be checked
for leaks. No visible leakage shall occur in
one minute using a suitable gas and air leak
detector solution.

5.4 Main valve function check
CAUTION
This test must be performed at a slow rate of
pressure increase to ensure that the main valve
does not go into full lift. The pressure applied to
the inlet is not to exceed 105% of nameplate set
pressure.
After completing the high pressure leakage
check of paragraph 5.3, verify main valve
opening as follows. Remove the leakage test
device from the outlet flange. Slowly increase
the inlet pressure above 90% of set pressure.
Continue increasing inlet pressure until an
audible discharge at the valve outlet verifies
main valve opening.

5.5 Iso-Sense pilot operated pressure relief
valve
In this special pilot operated pressure relief
valve, the sense pressure applied to the pilot
inlet/sense port is supplied from a remote
source and the sense pressure media is
isolated from the process media. The valve
assembly is available for either a gas or
liquid process media with either a gas or
liquid sense media. The typical Iso-Sense
pilot operated pressure relief valve shown in
Figure 13 below is presented for identification
purposes only. This is a special pressure relief
valve assembly which may require special set
pressure adjustment procedures. Contact
Anderson Greenwood for replacement parts
and maintenance instructions for individual
valve assemblies (serial number is required for
complete identification).

6 PILOT SET PRESSURE FIELD TEST
PROCEDURE
6.1 General
CAUTION
If the pressure relief valve is not isolated from
the process media while performing this test, the
main valve will open if system pressure rises to
set point or above.
The set pressure of valves equipped with a field
test accessory can be checked with the valve
installed, in operation. The field test accessory
consists of a check valve in the pilot supply line
through which test pressure from an external
source can be supplied to the pilot. A test
set-up similar to that shown in Figure 14 and
procedure similar to the following should be
used. This procedure accurately checks the set
pressure; it does not provide an accurate check
of reseat pressure.
NOTE
Gas flows through the flexible hose and vents past the
indicator plunger to atmosphere when the plunger
begins to retract. With gas flowing through the hose,
there will be a pressure drop from the gas bottle
to the field test fitting port. To ensure an accurate
reading of set pressure, the flexible hose should be
a ⅜” inside diameter hose and if the length exceeds
10-feet, the test gauge should be positioned at the
alternate location (see Figure 14). If the test gas is
supplied through a regulator, the effective orifice
diameter of the regulator should be a minimum
of 0.125-inch.
The main valve will not open while performing
this field test as long as the process pressure
remains below the set pressure. To cause the
main valve to open, slowly increase the test
pressure above the set pressure until the piston
lifts and process media is discharged through
the main valve. To close the main valve, close
block valve ‘A’ and open vent valve ‘C’.

6.2 Procedure
A. Connect flexible hose from test gas bottle to
field test fitting port.
B. Close vent valve ‘C’.
C. Open block valve ‘A’ slowly to increase
pressure until the indicator actuates. The
set pressure will be the pressure indicated
on the test gauge at the time gas vents past
the indicator plunger and/or the indicator
plunger retracts (test gauge reading will
decrease if rate of pressure increase is
sufficiently slow).
WARNING
Keep all parts of body clear of indicator plunger
during test to avoid contact with gas venting past
the indicator plunger.
D. To remove set up, close block valve ‘A’, open
vent valve ‘C’, and remove flexible hose from
field test fitting port.
