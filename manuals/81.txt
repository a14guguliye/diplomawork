2 VALVE REPAIR (-4, -6, -8 ORIFICE)
Refer to Figure 1
2.1 Disassembly
2.1.1 Relieve spring tension and back
blowdown adjusting screw out two turns.
2.1.2 Remove inlet bushing, bushing seal and
valve internals.
2.1.3 Separate nozzle from guide by hitting top
of spindle on soft surface.
2.2 Repair
2.2.1 Hold spindle by skirt O.D. in soft jaw vise
and replace seat.
2.2.2 Examine nozzle and polish out any
scratches or nicks. Replace if necessary.
2.2.3 To obtain better seat seal with PTFE at

INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE INSTRUCTIONS
4 VALVE ADJUSTMENT
4.1 General
Two adjustments are provided on gas service
valves, one for adjusting the opening pressure
and one for adjusting the closing pressure.
4.2 Set pressure
Turn spring adjustment screw on bonnet in most
of the way. Increase pressure to desired level
and back out screw until valve pops. Lock screw
with jam nut and retest. Readjust as required.
4.3 Reseat pressure
To adjust blowdown, turn blowdown adjustment
screw IN to shorten blowdown; OUT to increase
blowdown.
Note: if volume of test set up is too small,
blowdown will be set too short even though
pressure gauge indicates it to be correct.
Refer to Section 4.5.
4.4 Adjustments tolerances
Two adjustments are provided on gas service
valves, one for adjusting the opening pressure
and one for adjusting the closing pressure.

4.5 Adjusting equipment
Where practical, valves should be set using
an accumulator large enough to accurately
read and set blowdown. For a -4 orifice up
to 4000 psig (27579 kpag), -6 orifice up to
1410 psig (9722 kpag) and a -8 orifice up to
600 psig (4137 kpag), a four cubic foot (0.113 m3
)
accumulator is recommended. The supply pipe
to the valve should be the same size as the inlet
or larger and not more than 10” (254 mm) long.
For all other valves, or if an accumulator is
not available for the sizes listed above, the
blowdown may be set using the following
method.
Turn the blowdown adjusting bolt all the way in
until it just touches the guide, then turn it out
the number of turns listed in the table.

5 SEAT LEAKAGE
5.1 General
If the valve leaks after repair check the following:
5.1.1 Full and even seating of nozzle and guide.
5.1.2 Foreign particles trapped between the
seat and nozzle. If any are found they
may have damaged the seat, making it
necessary to replace it.
5.1.3 Correct seat material for the valve
set pressure.If items 1 and 2 reveal
no evident seat leakage source, the
procedures described in Section 5.2 may
be used to eliminate seat leakage. Section
5.2 applies only to teflon seated -4, -6, or
-8 orifice Series 81’s with nameplate set
pressures that do not exceed 300 psig
(2068 kpag).
5.2 Seat sealing procedures
Heat the valve for 15 to 30 minutes in a
oven preheated to 250-300°F (121-149°C).
A concentrated heat source such as a heat
gun or open flame must not be used. After
the valve has air-cooled to room temperature,
retest per Section 4.0 to insure seat tightness.
If  results have not improved, the valve should
be disassembled and the seat replaced.
6 SET PRESSURE CHANGE
If the set pressure is changed more than ±5%
from the nameplate set pressure, the spring,
spring washers, spring bonnet, guide plugs and
seat may also have to be changed. Consult the
factory or refer to the soft goods repair kit, the
table in Section 3.3 and spring chart 03.0079.
