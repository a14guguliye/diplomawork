4.1 General
Two adjustments are provided on gas service
valves, one for adjusting the opening pressure
and one for adjusting the closing pressure.
4.2 Set pressure
Turn spring adjustment screw on bonnet in most
of the way. Increase pressure to desired level
and back out screw until valve pops. Lock screw
with jam nut and retest. Readjust as required.

To adjust blowdown, turn screw IN to shorten
blowdown; OUT to increase blowdown.
NOTE
If volume of test set up is too small, blowdown will be
set too short even though pressure gauge indicates it
to be correct. Refer to Section 4.5.

4.5 Adjusting equipment
Where practical, valves should be set using
an accumulator large enough to accurately
read and set blowdown. For a -4 orifice up
to 4000 psig, -6 orifice up to 1411 psig and
a -8 orifice up to 600 psig, a four cubic foot
accumulator is recommended. The supply pipe
to the valve should be the same size as the inlet
or larger and not more than 10” long.
For all other valves, or if an accumulator is not
available for the sizes listed above, the blowdown
may be set using the following method.
Turn the blowdown adjusting bolt all the way in
until it just touches the guide, then turn it out
the number of turns listed in the table.
5 SEAT LEAKAGE
If the valve leaks after repair check the
following:
1. Full and even seating of nozzle and guide.
2. Foreign particles trapped between the seat
and nozzle. If any are found they may have
damaged the seat, making it necessary to
replace it.
3. Correct seat hardness for the valve set
pressure.
6 SET PRESSURE CHANGE
If the set pressure is changed more than + 5%
from the nameplate set pressure, the spring,
spring washers, spring bonnet, guide plugs and
seat may also have to be changed. Consult the
factory or refer to the soft goods repair kit, the
table in section 3.3 and spring chart 03.0079.
