Principle of Operation
Piston movement is accomplished by loading air pressure on one side of the piston, and unloading air pressure from
the other side of the piston. If no positioner is used with the control valve, a loading device, such as a 4‐way switching
valve, must be provided. Such a device is not furnished with the actuator.
Refer to the separate valve positioner instruction manual for the 1061 actuator principle of operation with positioner.
Installation
When an actuator and valve are shipped together, the actuator is normally mounted on the valve. Follow the valve
instructions when installing the control valve in the pipeline. If the actuator is shipped separately or if it is necessary to
mount the actuator on the valve, perform the procedures presented in the Actuator Mounting section.
WARNING
To avoid personal injury, always wear protective gloves, clothing, and eyewear when performing any installation
operations.
To avoid personal injury or property damage caused by bursting of pressure retaining parts, be certain the service
conditions do not exceed the limits given in table 1 or on the nameplate. Use pressure limiting or pressure relieving devices
to prevent the cylinder pressure from exceeding the maximum allowable cylinder operating pressure.
Check with your process or safety engineer for any additional measures that must be taken to protect against process
media.
If installing into an existing application, also refer to the WARNING at the beginning of the Maintenance section in this
instruction manual.
Actuator Mounting
Use the following steps to connect a valve and actuator that have been ordered separately, or if the valve or actuator
were separated for maintenance purposes.
Key numbers used in this procedure are shown in figures 8, 9 and 11.
WARNING
Perform the steps in the WARNING at the beginning of the Maintenance section.

WARNING
To avoid possible personal injury, do not stroke the actuator while the cover (key 34) is off.
a. If no handwheel actuator is to be used, position the travel indicator (key 38) according to the valve disk or ball
position just noted. Replace the cover (key 34), and secure it with the washers and cap screws (keys 76 and 35). If the
holes in the cover and housing (key 21) do not align, temporarily loosen the cap screws (key 24) and shift the housing
slightly. Do not stroke the actuator while the cover is off.
b. If a manual handwheel actuator is to be used, refer to the separate instruction manual for mounting
instructions.
18. If the 1061 actuator is equipped with an auxiliary handwheel actuator, make certain that a cylinder bypass valve
(key 68, figure 10) is also used to equalize cylinder pressure during handwheel operation. Operating the handwheel
actuator by itself against the force of differential cylinder pressures is difficult or even impossible. Install a bypass
valve as shown in figure 10. If the actuator was equipped with a valve positioner, refer to the positioner instruction
manual mounting procedures.
Changing Actuator Mounting
The actuator is normally positioned vertically in a horizontal pipeline. However, four mounting styles and four
positions are possible for each style. See figure 2.
Be sure to refer to the appropriate valve instruction manual for lever/valve shaft orientation, when changing styles
and/or positions. Most mounting changes will require the actuator lever to change position in relationship to the valve
splined shaft. It is possible to damage the valve if the actuator drives the valve disk or ball past its fully open or fully
closed position.
Refer to the Actuator Mounting section, to disassemble and assemble the actuator when changing the style or
position of the actuator.
CAUTION
Do not use a hammer or similar tool to drive the lever (key 28) off the valve shaft. Driving the lever could damage internal
valve parts. On some valves, driving the lever off the shaft could move the valve disk or ball and bearings away from the
centered position, causing subsequent damage to valve parts as the valve is operated.
If necessary, use a wheel puller to remove the lever from the valve shaft. It is permissible to tap the wheel puller screw
lightly to loosen the lever, but hitting the screw with excessive force could damage valve parts or disrupt the centered
position of the valve disk or ball and bearings.
When changing styles and/or positions, most mounting changes will require the actuator lever to change position in
relationship to the valve splined shaft. It is possible to damage the valve if the actuator drives the valve disk or ball past its
fully open or fully closed position.
Key numbers referenced in the following procedures are shown in figures 8, 9 and 11.
Changing Styles
Style A is right‐hand mounted while Style D is left‐hand mounted. In all other ways, styles A and D are identical.
Style B is right‐hand mounted while Style C is left‐hand mounted. In all other ways, styles B and C are identical.

The actuator housing, for style A & D is turned 180 degrees to convert it to a style B & C, or vice versa. In other words,
the actuator cover (key 34) is removed and placed on the mounting yoke (key 23) side.
The mounting yoke is placed on the cover side of the actuator housing (key 21). The lever (key 28) must be removed
and replaced during the procedure. Refer to figure 2 and note the relationship of the valve style and the pipeline.

Changing Positions
The actuator housing (key 21) position, and its orientation with the mounting yoke (key 23) can be changed into four
different positions. Refer to figure 2 and note the possible positions for each style.
Pressure Connections
1. Connect either pipe or tubing between the actuator pressure connections and the instrument. Keep the length of
pipe or tubing as short as possible to avoid transmission lag in the control signal.
2. When the control valve is completely installed and connected to the instrument, check for correct action
(air‐to‐open or air‐to‐close) to match the controlling instrument. For successful operation, the actuator stem and
valve shaft must move freely in response to the loading pressure change on the piston.
Adjustment
The only adjustment on the 1061 actuator is to make sure that the valve disk or ball is correctly closed when the
actuator piston is against the travel stop. For accurate adjustment to the zero‐degree valve disk or ball position, you
must remove the control valve from the pipeline. Refer to the valve instruction manual for instructions during this
procedure.
If the actuator is equipped with a manual handwheel actuator, make sure that the manual actuator is disengaged from
the valve shaft and that the bypass valve (key 68, figure 10) is closed before you perform adjustment procedures.
Perform the following steps to adjust the actuator turnbuckle. A regulated air supply will be required to stroke the
actuator during this procedure. Also, when you perform this adjustment, refer to table 4 for the sizes of open‐end
wrenches required to loosen and tighten the hex nuts and turnbuckle.
Key numbers referenced in this procedure are shown in figures 8, 9, and 11.
WARNING
Perform the steps in the WARNING at the beginning of the Maintenance section.
1. Refer to instructions in the appropriate valve instruction manual.

2. Remove the access plate (key 72). Also remove the machine screws (key 73) if present.
Note
The cover (key 34) supports the outer end of the valve shaft and should not be removed during actuator adjustment.
3. Stroke the actuator until you can reach the lower hex nut (key 11) through the access opening. Loosen the hex nut.
4. Stroke the actuator until you can reach the left‐hand threaded upper hex nut (key 71) through the access opening.
Loosen the hex nut.
5. Perform one of the following:
a. Push‐down‐to‐close (extending piston rod closes the valve): Slowly stroke the actuator to the down travel stop.
Refer to the appropriate valve instruction manual to determine the closed position of the valve. Adjust the
turnbuckle (key 70) until the valve is in the closed position. Lock this adjustment with the left‐hand threaded hex
nut (key 71). Stroke the actuator to the up travel stop, and tighten the lower hex nut (key 11). Check thread
engagement distance. The thread engagement should be the distance of the diameter of the thread. Tighten the
lower hex nut (key 11) using the torque values shown in table 3.
b. Push‐down‐to‐open (extending piston rod opens the valve): Stroke the actuator to the up travel stop. Refer to
the appropriate valve instruction manual to determine the closed position of the valve. Check the valve position.
Stroke the actuator until you reach the turnbuckle (key 70) through the access opening. Adjust the linkage.
Stroke the actuator to the up travel stop again, and check the new adjustment. Continue this procedure until the
valve is in the closed position when the actuator piston is resting against the up travel stop. Check thread
engagement distance. The thread engagement should be the distance of the diameter of the thread. Tighten the
lower hex nut (key 11) using the torque values shown in table 3.
6. Replace the access plate (key 72).
7. Loosen the self‐tapping screws (key 39), and adjust the travel indicator (key 38). Re‐tighten the self‐tapping screws.
CAUTION
If using a handwheel actuator, the valve shaft spline could be damaged if excessive torque is applied to the valve shaft by
the manual actuator while the 1061 power actuator is stopped at either end of travel. To protect the valve shaft, perform
the travel stop adjustment procedure found in the separate handwheel actuator instruction manual.
Maintenance
Actuator parts are subject to normal wear and must be inspected and replaced as necessary. The frequency of
inspection and replacement depends upon the severity of service conditions. Instructions are given below for
disassembly and replacement of parts.
WARNING
Avoid personal injury or property damage from sudden release of process pressure or uncontrolled movement of parts.
Before performing any maintenance operations:
 Do not remove the actuator from the valve while the valve is still pressurized.

 Always wear protective gloves, clothing, and eyewear when performing any maintenance operations to avoid personal
injury.
 Disconnect any operating lines providing air pressure, electric power, or a control signal to the actuator. Be sure the
actuator cannot suddenly open or close the valve.
 Use bypass valves or completely shut off the process to isolate the valve from process pressure. Relieve process pressure
from both sides of the valve. Drain the process media from both sides of the valve.
 Vent the power actuator loading pressure.
 Use lock‐out procedures to be sure that the above measures stay in effect while you work on the equipment.
 The valve packing box may contain process fluids that are pressurized, even when the valve has been removed from the
pipeline. Process fluids may spray out under pressure when removing the packing hardware or packing rings, or when
loosening the packing box pipe plug.
 Check with your process or safety engineer for any additional measures that must be taken to protect against process
media.
Key numbers are shown in figures 8, 9 and 11.
Disassembly
The following procedure describes how to completely disassemble the actuator. When inspecting and replacing parts,
perform only those steps necessary to accomplish the repair.
1. Isolate the control valve from the line pressure, release pressure from both sides of the valve body, and drain the
process media from both sides of the valve. Use lock‐out procedures to be sure that the above measures stay in
effect while you work on the equipment. Refer to instructions in the appropriate valve instruction manual.
2. Remove the positioner, if one is used. If necessary, refer to the positioner instruction manual for removal
instructions.
3. Unscrew the cap screws and washers (keys 35 and 76), and remove the cover (key 34). If an optional manual
handwheel actuator is used, it will be removed with the cover. Refer to the separate handwheel actuator instruction
manual for instructions.
4. Remove the retaining ring (key 31). If necessary, remove the travel indicator (key 38), by removing the screws (key
29) from the hub (key 30).
5. Inspect, and if necessary, replace the cover bushing (key 32). Remove the travel indicator scale (key 36) by
removing the self‐tapping screws (key 37). Press the bushing out of the cover (key 34).
6. Remove the cap screw and hex nut (keys 13 and 14) for size 30, 40, 60, and 68 actuators; the hex nut and washer
(keys 85 and 84) for size 80 and 100 actuators; or the cap screw and heavy hex nut for size 130 (key 13 and 85).
7. Note the lever/valve shaft orientation. Loosen cap screw (key 29). For size 80, 100 and 130 actuators, rotate set
screw (key 82) clockwise slightly to spread the split portion of the lever (key 28).
CAUTION
When removing the actuator from the valve, do not use a hammer or similar tool to drive the lever (key 28) off the valve
shaft. Driving the lever could damage internal valve parts. On some valves, driving the lever off the shaft could move the
valve disk or ball and bearings away from the centered position, causing subsequent damage to valve parts as the valve is
operated.
If necessary, use a wheel puller to remove the lever from the valve shaft. It is permissible to tap the wheel puller screw
lightly to loosen the lever, but hitting the screw with excessive force could damage valve parts or disrupt the centered
position of the valve disk or ball and bearings.

4. Make sure that the bolt is not threaded in so far that it will interfere with re‐assembly of the actuator.
5. Be sure the actuator piston rod is retracted fully. This will be the locked position of the valve. For a
push‐down‐to‐close valve and actuator, the valve will be fully open when locked. For a push‐down‐to‐open valve
and actuator, the valve will be fully closed when locked.
6. Screw the threaded bolt into the housing until it contacts the actuator lever cap screw.
7. Insert the padlock (not furnished) to connect the mounting plate (key 123) with the lower locking disk on the
mounting plate assembly (key 124). You might have to back off the lower locking disk a slight amount to line up the
holes for the padlock.
8. Tighten the jam nut (key 128) against the mounting plate.
9. Refer to the Operating the Locking Mechanism section.
For Size 80 & 100 Actuators
1. Attach the mounting plate (key 123) to the modified housing (key 21) as shown in figure 6. Attach it with the four
cap screws (key 129).
2. Thread the lockscrew (key 131) into the mounting bracket.
3. Make sure that the lockscrew is not threaded in so far that it will interfere with re‐assembly of the actuator.
4. Be sure the actuator piston rod is retracted fully. This will be the locked position of the valve. For a
push‐down‐to‐close valve and actuator, the valve will be fully open when locked. For a push‐down‐to‐open valve
and actuator, the valve will be fully closed when locked.
5. Screw the lockscrew into the housing until it contacts the actuator lever (key 28).
6. Screw the safety lockout (key 130) onto the mounting plate (key 123) until finger‐tight. Then back it off until the

Operating the Locking Mechanism
Key numbers are located in figures 5 and 6.
To Unlock the Actuator (Size 30, 40, 60, & 68)
1. Remove the padlock. Loosen the jam nut (key 128, figure 5), and unscrew the threaded bolt until it is stopped by
the groove pin (key 127) in the threaded bolt.
Note
For normal operation of the actuator, the threaded bolt must be unscrewed far enough so that the actuator lever will not contact
the bolt in normal actuator operation.
2. If you are going to leave the bolt threaded into the housing, lock it with the jam nut (key 128) so that it cannot be
screwed into the housing and interfere with normal actuator operation.
To Unlock the Actuator (Size 80 & 100)
1. Remove the padlock. Remove the safety lockout (key 130, figure 6) and unscrew the lockscrew until it is free of the
lever path.
Note
For normal operation of the actuator, the threaded bolt must be unscrewed far enough so that the actuator lever will not contact
the bolt in normal actuator operation. A good rule of thumb is to unscrew the lockscrew until it is approximately even with the
outward edge of the safety lockout when installed.
2. If you are going to leave the bolt threaded into the housing, reinstall the safety lockout and padlock.
To Lock the Actuator (Size 30, 40, 60, & 68)
1. Be sure the actuator piston rod is retracted fully. This will be the locked position of the valve. For a
push‐down‐to‐close valve and actuator, the valve will be fully open when locked. For a push‐down‐to‐open valve
and actuator, the valve will be fully closed when locked.
2. Be sure the jam nut (key 128, figure 5) is loose. Then, screw the threaded bolt into the housing until it contacts the
head on the cap screw of the actuator lever.
3. Rotate the threaded bolt until one of the holes in the lower locking disk (which is welded to the bolt) is in line with
the hole in the mounting plate (key 123). Tighten the jam nut against the mounting plate.
4. Lock the plate and disk together with a padlock (not furnished).
To Lock the Actuator (Size 80 & 100)
1. Be sure the actuator piston rod is retracted fully. This will be the locked position of the valve. For a
push‐down‐to‐close valve and actuator, the valve will be fully open when locked. For a push‐down‐to‐open valve
and actuator, the valve will be fully closed when locked.
2. Screw the lockscrew (key 131) into the housing until it contacts the actuator lever (key 28, figure 9).
3. Screw the safety lockout (key 130) onto the mounting plate (key 123) until finger‐tight. Then back it off until the
hole in the arm of the safety lockout aligns with the hole in the mounting plate for the padlock.
4. Insert and lock the padlock (not furnished) to connect the mounting plate (key 123) with the arm of the safety
lockout (key 130). The larger 1061 sizes may require a padlock with a longer shackle.

Pipe‐Away Vent
Some applications require venting of gas from the rotary actuator housing. The 3610 Series positioners vent into the
actuator housing, and from there, the gas has numerous avenues of escape.
WARNING
If a flammable, hazardous, or reactive gas is used as the supply pressure medium, personal injury or property damage could
result from fire or explosion of accumulated gas or from contact with hazardous or reactive gas.
The positioner on the control valve assembly does not form a gas‐tight seal. If the assembly is in an enclosed area, use a
remote vent line, and use other safety measures to adequately ventilate the assembly. A remote vent pipe alone cannot be
relied upon to remove all hazardous gas.
Vent line piping should comply with local and regional codes. It should be as short as possible with adequate inside
diameter and few bends to remove exhaust gases to a ventilated area.
Note
This modification is NOT intended to be a leak‐proof or pressure‐tight design. It is intended to aid in containing the gas that vents
from the positioner and allow for connection of piping to carry it away.
The Parts List section, at the end of this manual, provides...
 Retrofit kit numbers to modify an actuator for the vent piping
 Replacement parts for pipe‐away vents
 Retrofit kit numbers for modification of units in the field
Take care that adequate vent pipe size is used. This is particularly important with the larger size actuators with fast
stroking speed requirements. In these situations, large quantities of gas can be vented very quickly through the
positioner, and you must have adequate pipe‐away capability. Keep the vent piping as short as possible with few
bends.
Key numbers are shown in figure 7 unless otherwise noted. Refer to the actuator Disassembly and Assembly steps to
gain access to the following parts.
For installation and maintenance of the pipe‐away vent system, be sure to do the following:
WARNING
Perform the steps in the WARNING at the beginning of the Maintenance section.
Refer to instructions in the appropriate valve instruction manual.
Bushings—Remove the mounting yoke bushing (key 67), and the end plate cover bushing (key 31, figures 9 and 11),
then replace them with the pipe‐away vent parts. As shown in figure 7, the mounting yoke bushing (key 132) has two
pieces with an O‐ring (key 133) between them. The end plate cover repeats the assembly with a two‐piece bushing
(key 134) with an O‐ring between them (key 135).
Travel Indicator—A gasket (key 136) is placed under the travel indicator plate. Remove the indicator plate (key 37,
figures 8, 9 and 11), install the gasket (key 136) as shown in figure 7.
Housing Vent Plug—A vent is provided in the housing design. To plug this opening, the pipe‐away vent kit provides a
hex pipe plug (key 140) for this opening as shown in figure 7. Install the hex plug (key 140) into this opening and
tighten it.
