Description
DVC6200 digital valve controllers (figures 1‐1 and 1‐2) are communicating, microprocessor‐based
current‐to‐pneumatic instruments. In addition to the traditional function of converting an input current signal to a
pneumatic output pressure, the DVC6200 digital valve controller, using the HART communications protocol, gives
easy access to information critical to process operation. You can gain information from the principal component of the
process, the control valve itself, using the handheld communicator at the valve, or at a field junction box, or by using a

isolated circuitry for a valve position transmitter (for separate valve position feedback) or an integrated switch that can
be set as a limit switch or an alert switch.
Using a personal computer and ValveLink software or AMS Suite: Intelligent Device Manager, or a handheld
communicator, you can perform several operations with the DVC6200 digital valve controller. You can obtain general
information concerning software revision level, messages, tag, descriptor, and date.
Diagnostic information is available to aid you when troubleshooting. Input and output configuration parameters can
be set, and the digital valve controller can be calibrated. Refer to table 1‐1 for details on the capabilities of each
diagnostic tier.
Using the HART protocol, information from the field can be integrated into control systems or be received on a single
loop basis.

Section 2 Wiring Practices22
Control System Requirements
There are several parameters that should be checked to ensure the control system is compatible with the DVC6200
digital valve controller.
HART Filter
Depending on the control system you are using, a HART filter may be needed to allow HART communication. The
HART filter is a passive device that is inserted in field wiring from the HART loop. The filter is normally installed near the
field wiring terminals of the control system I/O (see figure 2‐1). Its purpose is to effectively isolate the control system
output from modulated HART communication signals and raise the impedance of the control system to allow HART
communication. For more information on the description and use of the HART filter, refer to the appropriate HART
filter instruction manual.
To determine if your system requires a filter contact your Emerson sales office.
Note
A HART filter is typically NOT required for any of the Emerson control systems, including PROVOX, RS3, and DeltaV systems.

Voltage Available
The voltage available at the DVC6200 digital valve controller must be at least 10 VDC. The voltage available at the
instrument is not the actual voltage measured at the instrument when the instrument is connected. The voltage
measured at the instrument is limited by the instrument and is typically less than the voltage available.
Instruction Manual
D103605X012
Wiring Practices
December 2022

As shown in figure 2‐2, the voltage available at the instrument depends upon:
 the control system compliance voltage
 if a filter, wireless THUM adapter, or intrinsic safety barrier is used, and
 the wire type and length.
The control system compliance voltage is the maximum voltage at the control system output terminals at which the
control system can produce maximum loop current.
The voltage available at the instrument may be calculated from the following equation:
Voltage Available = [Control System Compliance Voltage (at maximum current)] - [filter voltage drop (if a HART filter is
used)] - [total cable resistance  maximum current] - [barrier resistance x maximum current].
The calculated voltage available should be greater than or equal to 10 volts DC.
Table 2‐1 lists the resistance of some typical cables.
The following example shows how to calculate the voltage available for a Honeywell TDC2000 control system with a
HF340 HART filter, and 1000 feet of Belden 9501 cable:
Voltage available = [18.5 volts (at 21.05 mA)] - [2.3 volts] - [48 ohms  0.02105 amps]
Voltage available = [18.5] - [2.3] - [1.01]
Voltage available = 15.19 volts
Figure 2‐2. Determining Voltage Available at the Instrument
The voltage available at the instrument is not the voltage measured at the instrument terminals. Once the instrument is
connected, the instrument limits the measured voltage to approximately 8.0 to 9.5 volts.
Obtain filter voltage drop. The measured drop will be different than this value. The measured filter voltage drop
depends upon control system output voltage, the intrinsic safety barrier (if used), and the instrument. See note 3.

Auxiliary Terminal Wiring Length Guidelines
The Auxiliary Input Terminals of a DVC6200 with instrument level ODV can be used with a locally‐mounted switch for
initiating a partial stroke test. Some applications require that the switch be installed remotely from the DVC6200.
The length for wiring connected to the Auxiliary Input Terminals is limited by capacitance. For proper operation of the
Auxiliary Input Terminals capacitance should not exceed 100,000 pF. As with all control signal wiring, good wiring
practices should be observed to minimize adverse effect of electrical noise on the Aux Switch function.
Example Calculation: Capacitance per foot or per meter is required to calculate the length of wire that may be
connected to the Aux switch input. The wire should not exceed the capacitance limit of 100,000 pF. Typically the wire
manufacturer supplies a data sheet which provides all of the electrical properties of the wire. The pertinent parameter
is the highest possible capacitance. If shielded wire is used, the appropriate number is the “Conductor to Other
Conductor & Shield” value.
Example — 18AWG Unshielded Audio, Control and Instrumentation Cable
Manufacturer's specifications include:
Nom. Capacitance Conductor to Conductor @ 1 KHz: 26 pF/ft
Nom. Conductor DC Resistance @ 20 Deg. C: 5.96 Ohms/1000 ft
Max. Operating Voltage - UL 200 V RMS (PLTC, CMG),150 V RMS (ITC)
Allowable Length with this cable = 100,000pF /(26pF/ft) = 3846 ft
Example — 18AWG Shielded Audio, Control and Instrumentation Cable
Manufacturer's specifications include:
Nom. Characteristic Impedance: 29 Ohms
Nom. Inductance: .15 μH/ft
Nom. Capacitance Conductor to Conductor @ 1 KHz: 51 pF/ft
Nom. Cap. Cond. to other Cond. & Shield @ 1 KHz 97 pF/ft
Allowable Length with this cable = 100,000pF /(97pF/ft) = 1030 ft
The AUX switch input passes less than 1 mA through the switch contacts, and uses less than 5V, therefore, neither the
resistance nor the voltage rating of the cable are critical. Ensure that switch contact corrosion is prevented. It is
generally advisable that the switch have gold‐plated or sealed contacts.
Maximum Cable Capacitance
The maximum cable length for HART communication is limited by the characteristic capacitance of the cable.
Maximum length due to capacitance can be calculated using the following formulas:
Length(ft) = [160,000 - Cmaster(pF)]  [Ccable(pF/ft)]
Length(m) = [160,000 - Cmaster(pF)]  [Ccable(pF/m)]
where:
160,000 = a constant derived for FIELDVUE instruments to ensure that the HART network RC time constant will be no
greater than 65 μs (per the HART specification).
Cmaster = the capacitance of the control system or HART filter
Ccable = the capacitance of the cable used (see table 2‐1)
Instruction Manual
D103605X012
Wiring Practices
December 2022
13
The following example shows how to calculate the cable length for a Foxboro I/A control system (1988) with a Cmaster
of 50, 000 pF and a Belden 9501 cable with characteristic capacitance of 50pF/ft.
Length(ft) = [160,000 - 50,000pF]  [50pF/ft]
Length = 2200 ft.
The HART communication cable length is limited by the cable characteristic capacitance. To increase cable length,
select a wire with lower capacitance per foot. Contact your Emerson sales office for specific information relating to
your control system.

Commissioning the Digital Valve Controller for use with the HART
Tri‐Loop Signal Converter
To prepare the digital valve controller for use with a 333 HART Tri‐Loop, you must configure the digital valve controller
to burst mode, and select Burst Command 3. In burst mode, the digital valve controller provides digital information to
the HART Tri‐Loop HART‐to‐Analog Signal Converter. The HART Tri‐Loop converts the digital information to a 4 to 20
mA analog signal. Each burst message contains the latest value of the primary (analog input), secondary (travel
target), tertiary (configured output pressure), and quaternary (travel) variables.
To commission a DVC6200 for use with a HART Tri‐Loop, perform the following procedures.
Note
Fast-key sequences are only applicable to the 475 Field Communicator. They do not apply to the Trex Device Communicator.

Guided Setup
Handheld Communicator Configure > Guided Setup (2‐1)
To quickly setup the instrument, the following procedures will guide you through the process.
Device Setup is used to configure the unique parameters for the valve, actuator, instrument and accessory
construction. After Device Setup is complete, proceed with Auto Calibration.
Auto Calibration is used to establish the limits of physical travel. During this process, the valve will fully stroke from
one travel extreme to the other. There are three calibration options to choose from:
 Autocalibrate – Standard runs the full calibration process (recommended).
 Autocalibrate – Without Biases establishes the travel end points, but does not adjust the Minor Loop Feedback
bias. This is for advanced use when manually setting the biases for large actuators.
 Advanced Settings allows additional custom configuration of calibration parameters. This is for advanced use
when calibrating large actuators.
Manual Setup33
Manual Setup allows you to configure the digital valve controller to your application. Table 3‐1 lists the default settings
for a standard factory configuration. You can adjust actuator response, set the various modes, alerts, ranges, travel
cutoffs and limits. You can also restart the instrument and set the protection.

Mode and Protection
Handheld Communicator Configure > Manual Setup > Mode and Protection (2‐2‐1)
Instrument Mode
There are two instrument modes for the DVC6200; In Service or Out of Service. In Service is the normal operating
mode such that the instrument follows the 4­20 mA control signal. Out of Service is required in some cases to modify
configuration parameters or to run diagnostics.
Note
Some changes that require the instrument to be taken Out Of Service will not take effect until the instrument is placed back In
Service or the instrument is restarted.
Write Protection
There are two Write Protection modes for the DVC6200: Not Protected or Protected. Protected prevents configuration
and calibration changes to the instrument. The default setting is Not Protected. Write Protection can be changed to
Protected remotely. However, to change Write Protection to Not Protected, you must have physical access to the
instrument. The procedure will require you to press a button ( ) on the terminal box as a security measure.

17
 Description—Enter a description for the application with up to 16 characters. The description provides a longer
user‐defined electronic label to assist with more specific instrument identification than is available with the HART
tag.
 Message—Enter any message with up to 32 characters. Message provides the most specific user‐defined means for
identifying individual instruments in multi‐instrument environments.
 Polling Address—If the digital valve controller is used in point‐to‐point operation, the Polling Address is 0. When
several devices are connected in the same loop, such as for split ranging, each device must be assigned a unique
polling address. The Polling Address is set to a value between 0 and 63 for HART 7 and 0 and 15 for HART 5. To
change the polling address the instrument must be Out Of Service.
For the handheld communicator to be able to communicate with a device whose polling address is not 0, it must be
configured to automatically search for all or specific connected devices.
Serial Numbers
 Instrument Serial Number—Enter the serial number on the instrument nameplate, up to 12 characters.
 Valve Serial Number—Enter the serial number for the valve in the application, up to 12 characters.
Units
 Pressure Units—Defines the output and supply pressure units in either psi, bar, kPa, or kg/cm2.
 Temperature Units—Degrees Fahrenheit or Celsius. The temperature measured is from a sensor mounted on the
digital valve controller's printed wiring board.
 Analog Input Units—Permits defining the Analog Input Units in mA or percent of 4-20 mA range.
Terminal Box
 Calibration (CAL) Button—This button is near the wiring terminals in the terminal box and provides a quick means to
autocalibrate the instrument. The button must be pressed for 3 to 10 seconds. Autocalibration will move the valve
through the full range of travel whether the Instrument Mode is In Service or Out of Service. However, if the Write
Protection is Protected, this button will not be active. To abort, press the button again for 1 second. The calibration
button is disabled by default.
 Auxiliary Terminal Action—These wire terminals can be configured to initiate a partial stroke test upon detection of
a short across the (+) and (-) terminals. The terminals must be shorted for 3 to 10 seconds.
Note
Auxiliary Terminal Action is only available for instrument level ODV.
Analog Input Range
 Input Range Hi—Permits setting the Input Range High value. Input Range High should correspond to Travel Range
High, if the Zero Power Condition is configured as closed. If the Zero Power Condition is configured as open, Input
Range High corresponds to Travel Range Low. See figure 3‐1.

or if the Tvl Dev Press Fallback setting is exceeded for more than the Tvl Dev Press Fallback Time.
Note
Travel / Pressure Select must be set to Travel for double‐acting actuators
Cutoffs and Limits
 Hi Limit/Cutoff Select—When the Hi Cutoff/Limit Select is configured for Cutoff, the Travel Target is set to 123%
when the Travel exceeds the Hi Cutoff Point. When the Hi Cutoff/Limit Select is configured for Limit, the Travel
Target will not exceed the Hi Limit Point.
 Hi Limit/Cutoff Point—This is the point within the calibrated travel range above which the Limit or Cutoff is in effect.
When using cutoffs, a Cutoff Hi of 99.5% is recommended to ensure valve goes fully open. The Hi Cutoff/Limit is
deactivated by setting it to 125%.
 Hi Soft Cutoff Rate—This setting allows the valve to ramp to the high travel extreme when the Cutoff Point is
reached at the configured rate. This provides a controlled ramp into the open travel stop. When set to 0%/sec, the
Hi Soft Cutoff rate is disabled.
 Lo Limit/Cutoff Select—When the Lo Cutoff/Limit Select is configured for Cutoff, the Travel Target is set to ­23%
when the Travel is below the Lo Cutoff Point. When the Hi Cutoff/Limit Select is configured for Limit, the Travel
Target will not fall below the Lo Limit Point.
 Lo Limit/Cutoff Point—This is the point within the calibrated travel range below which the Limit or Cutoff is in effect.
When using cutoffs, a Cutoff Lo of 0.5% is recommended to help ensure maximum shutoff seat loading. The Lo
Limit/Cutoff is deactivated by setting it to ­25%.
 Lo Soft Cutoff Rate—This setting allows the valve to ramp to the low travel extreme when the Cutoff Point is reached
at the configured rate. This provides a controlled ramp into the seat in order to minimize seat damage. When set to
0%/sec, the Lo Soft Cutoff rate is disabled.
Pressure Control
 Pressure Range High—The high end of output pressure range. Enter the pressure that corresponds with 100% valve
travel when Zero Power Condition is closed, or 0% valve travel when Zero Power Condition is open. This pressure
must be greater than the Pressure Range Lo.
 Pressure Range Lo—The low end of the output pressure range. Enter the pressure that corresponds to 0% valve
travel when Zero Power Condition is closed, or 100% valve travel when Zero Power Condition is open. This pressure
must be less than the Pressure Range Hi.

Pressure Fallback
Note
Pressure Fallback is available for instrument level AD, PD, ODV.
 Tvl Dev Press Fallback—When the difference between the travel target and the actual travel exceeds this value for
more than the Tvl Dev Press Fallback Time, the instrument will disregard the travel feedback and control based on
output pressure.
 Tvl Dev Press Fallback Time—This is the time, in seconds, that the travel target and the actual travel must be
exceeded before the instrument falls back into pressure control.
 Fallback Recovery—If the instrument has fallen into pressure control and the feedback problem is resolved, recovery
to travel control can occur automatically or with manual intervention. To return to travel control when Manual
Recovery is selected, change the Fallback Recovery to Auto Recovery, and then back to Manual Recovery (if
desired).
Control Mode
 Control Mode—This displays the current control mode of the instrument. This will show Analog if the instrument is
in Point­to­Point mode and is using a 4­20 mA signal for its power and set point. This will show Digital if the
instrument is in Multidrop mode and is using 24 VDC for power and a digital set point for control.
Note
Another mode, Test, may be displayed. Normally the instrument should not be in the Test mode. The digital valve controller
automatically switches to this mode whenever it needs to stroke the valve during calibration or stroke valve, for example.
However, if you abort from a procedure where the instrument is in the test mode, it may remain in this mode. To take the
instrument out of the Test mode, select Change Control Mode and enter Analog or Digital.
 Change Control Mode—This allows the user to configure the control mode to Analog or Digital.
 Restart Control Mode—This defines the Control Mode of the instrument after a restart (e.g. power cycle). Available
choices are Resume Last, Analog and Digital.

Characterization
 Input Characterization
Input Characterization defines the relationship between the travel target and ranged set point. Ranged set point is the
input to the characterization function. If the zero power condition equals closed, then a set point of 0% corresponds to
a ranged input of 0%. If the zero power condition equals open, a set point of 0% corresponds to a ranged input of 100%.
Travel target is the output from the characterization function.
To select an input characterization, select Input Characterization from the Characterization menu. You can select from
the three fixed input characteristics shown in figure 3‐2 or you can select a custom characteristic. Figure 3‐2 shows the
relationship between the travel target and ranged set point for the fixed input characteristics, assuming the Zero
Power Condition is configured as closed.
You can specify 21 points on a custom characteristic curve. Each point defines a travel target, in % of ranged travel, for
a corresponding set point, in % of ranged set point. Set point values range from -6.25% to 106.25%. Before
modification, the custom characteristic is linear.
 Custom Characterization
To define a custom input character, select Custom Characterization from the Characterization menu. Select the point
you wish to define (1 to 21), then enter the desired set point value. Press Enter then enter the desired travel target for
the corresponding set point. When finished, select point 0 to return to the Characterization menu.
With input characterization you can modify the overall characteristic of the valve and instrument combination.
Selecting an equal percentage, quick opening, or custom (other than the default of linear) input characteristic
modifies the overall valve and instrument characteristic. However, if you select the linear input characteristic, the
overall valve and instrument characteristic is the characteristic of the valve, which is determined by the valve trim (i.e.,
the plug or cage).

Dynamic Response
 SP Rate Open—Maximum rate (% of valve travel per second) at which the digital valve controller will move to the
open position regardless of the rate of input current change. A value of 0 will deactivate this feature and allow the
valve to stroke open as fast as possible.
 SP Rate Close—Maximum rate (% of valve travel per second) at which the digital valve controller will move to the
close position regardless of the rate of input current change. A value of 0 will deactivate this feature and allow the
valve to stroke close as fast as possible.
 Set Point Filter Time (Lag Time)—The Set Point Filter Time (Lag Time) slows the response of the digital valve
controller. A value ranging from 0.2 to 10.0 can be used for noisy or fast processes to improve closed loop process
control. Entering a value of 0.0 will deactivate the lag filter.
Note
Set Point Filter Time (Lag Time) is available for instrument level HC, AD, and PD.
 Lead/Lag Set Point Filter—ODV devices have access to a lead‐lag set point filter that can be used to improve a valve's
dynamic response. The lead‐lag filter is part of the set point processing routine that reshapes the input signal before
it becomes travel set point. Lead‐lag filters are characterized by lead and lag time constants.
Note
Lead/Lag is only available for instrument level ODV.
When the valve is in its active control region (off the seat), the lead‐lag filter improves small amplitude response by
momentarily overdriving the travel set point. This is useful when the actuator is large and equipped with accessories.
As a result, any volume boosters that are present will be activated. The longer the lag time, the more pronounced the
overdrive. Since the lead‐lag input filter is used to enhance the dynamic response of a control valve, filter parameters
should be set after the tuning parameters have been established.
When the valve is at its seat, the lead‐lag filter also has a boost function that sets the initial conditions of the filter
artificially low so that small amplitude signal changes appear to be large signal changes to the filter. The boost
function introduces a large spike that momentarily overdrives the instrument and activates any external volume
boosters that may be present. The lead‐lag boost function is normally disabled except for those cases where the valve
must respond to small command signals off the seat. By setting the lead/lag ratio in the opening and closing directions
to 1.0, the boost function can be enabled without introducing lead‐lag dynamics in the active control region. See table
3‐2 for typical lead‐lag filter settings.

feedback gain. Individually setting or changing any tuning parameter or running Stabilize/Optimize will automatically
change the tuning set to X (expert).
Note
Use Expert tuning only if standard tuning has not achieved the desired results.
Stabilize/Optimize or Performance Tuner in ValveLink software, may be used to achieve the desired results more rapidly than
manual Expert tuning.
Table 3‐4 provides tuning set selection guidelines for Fisher and Baumann actuators. These tuning sets are only
recommended starting points. After you finish setting up and calibrating the instrument, you may have to select either

 Proportional Gain—the proportional gain for the travel control tuning set. Changing this parameter will also change
the tuning set to Expert.
 Velocity Gain—the velocity gain for the travel control tuning set. Changing this parameter will also change the
tuning set to Expert.
 MLFB Gain—the minor loop feedback gain for the travel control tuning set. Changing this parameter will also change
the tuning set to Expert.
 Integral Enable—Yes or No. Enable the integral setting to improve static performance by correcting for error that
exists between the travel target and actual travel. Travel Integral Control is enabled by default.
 Integral Gain—Travel Integral Gain is the ratio of the change in output to the change in input, based on the control
action in which the output is proportional to the time integral of the input.
 Stabilize/Optimize
 WARNING
During Stabilize/Optimize the valve may move, causing process fluid or pressure to be released. To avoid personal injury
and property damage caused by the release of process fluid or pressure, isolate the valve from the process and equalize
pressure on both sides of the valve or bleed off the process fluid.
Stabilize/Optimize permits you to adjust valve response by changing the digital valve controller tuning. During this
routine the instrument must be out of service, however, the instrument will respond to setpoint changes.
If the valve is unstable select decrease response for a more conservative setting. If the valve response is sluggish, select
increase response for a more aggressive setting. When finished select Done.

Note
As a general rule, do not use less than 60% of the magnet assembly travel range for full travel measurement. Performance will
decrease as the assembly is increasingly subranged.
The linear magnet assemblies have a valid travel range indicated by arrows molded into the piece. This means that the hall sensor
(on the back of the DVC6200 housing) has to remain within this range throughout the entire valve travel. The linear magnet
assemblies are symmetrical. Either end may be up.

Travel Sensor Motion
 WARNING
If you answer YES to the prompt for permission to move the valve when determining travel sensor motion, the instrument
will move the valve through a significant portion of its travel range. To avoid personal injury and property damage caused
by the release of process fluid or pressure, isolate the valve from the process and equalize pressure on both sides of the
valve or bleed off the process fluid.
Select Clockwise/Toward Bottom, or Counterclockwise/Toward Top. Travel Sensor Motion establishes the proper
travel sensor rotation. For quarter‐turn actuators determine rotation by viewing the rotation of the magnet assembly
from the back of the instrument.
Note
Travel Sensor Motion in this instance refers to the motion of the magnet assembly. Note that the magnet assembly may be
referred to as a magnetic array in user interface tools.
 For instruments with Relay A and C: If increasing air pressure at output A causes the magnet assembly to move
down or the rotary shaft to turn clockwise, enter CW/To Bottom Inst. If it causes the magnet assembly to move up,
or the rotary shaft to turn counterclockwise, enter CCW/To Top Inst.
 For instruments with Relay B: If decreasing air pressure at output B causes the magnet assembly to down, or the
rotary shaft to turn clockwise, enter CW/To Bottom Inst. If it causes the magnet assembly to move up, or the rotary
shaft to turn counterclockwise, enter CCW/To Top Inst.

Port A Pressure Limit
In single acting direct only applications, the instrument will limit the output pressure to the actuator from Port A.
When this pressure limit is exceeded the device will go to the no air state.
Note
This is a firmware controlled feature that requires loop power to the instrument. If loop power is lost, or there is an electronic or
firmware failure, the protection feature will not remain in effect.

There is an associated alert available with this feature. See the Port A Overpressurized alert in the Alert Setup section.
Partial Stroke Test (PST)
Handheld Communicator Configure > Manual Setup > Partial Stroke (2-2-7)
Note
Partial Stroke is only available for instrument level ODV.
Partial Stroke Test Parameters
Test Start Point defines the normal (not tripped) end of valve travel. The valve must be at this end for a PST to be
initiated. Setting this value to Not Configured will disable partial stroke tests.
Travel Hi Hi defines, in percent (%) of calibrated travel, the point above which the valve is considered to have reached
the high end.
Travel Lo Lo defines, in percent (%) of calibrated travel, the point below which the valve is considered to have reached
the low end.
Pause Time is the time between the outgoing and incoming strokes of the test. The default value is 5 seconds. Pause
Time will not be used if Short Duration PST is enabled. The outgoing stroke is from the normal end to the PST target
and the incoming stroke is the return stroke to normal. See figure 3‐4.

Outgoing Ramp Rate is the rate at which the valve will move during the Outgoing stroke of the Partial Stroke test. The
default value is 0.25%/second.
Incoming Ramp Rate is the rate at which the valve will move during the Incoming stroke of the Partial Stroke test. The
default value is 0.25%/second.
Return Lead defines the percent (%) change in setpoint to overcome the hysteresis in the valve assembly. The error
between setpoint and actual error is added to this percent change. For example, if the Return Lead is set at 0.5% and
there is a 1% error this will be set at 1.5%
Breakout Timeout is the user configured amount of time before which the valve must leave the normal end during a
PST.
Outgoing Pressure Threshold defines the actuator pressure at which a partial stroke test will abort during the outgoing
stroke (see figure 3‐4). This prevents the DVC6200 from exhausting (or building) excessive pressure from/to the
actuator in an attempt to move a stuck valve. During PST Calibration, the Partial Stroke Outgoing Pressure Threshold
will be set automatically as follows:
 Single Acting Actuators - For those actuators that exhaust pressure from the partial test start point, the Outgoing
Pressure Threshold will be a minimum value. For those actuators that build pressure from the partial test start point,
the Outgoing Pressure Threshold will be a maximum value.
 Double Acting Actuators - The Outgoing Pressure Threshold will be set to a negative value for actuators where the
partial stroke start point is opposite of the Zero Power Condition (e.g., Partial Stroke Start Point = Open and Zero
Power Condition = Closed) and to a positive value for actuators where the partial stroke start point is the same as the
Zero Power Condition.

To manually set the partial stroke Outgoing Pressure Threshold, you must examine current partial stroke test results
using ValveLink software. The following steps will guide you through the process:
1. Connect the DVC6200 to a system running ValveLink software.
2. Disable Partial Stroke Outgoing Pressure Limit by ensuring it is not selected as an evaluation criteria for PST
Abnormal.
3. Run a partial stroke test.
4. Select the Press/Time radio button on the partial stroke graph (refer to the example in figure 3‐6). If the actuator
pressure starts high and moves low, find the minimum actuator pressure (Pmin). If the actuator pressure starts low
and moves high, find the maximum actuator pressure (Pmax). Double­acting actuators will display differential
pressure. Use table 3‐7 to estimate the Outgoing Pressure Threshold.
5. Enable the previously disabled Outgoing Pressure Limit - calculate the value using table 3‐7.

 Output Terminal Enable—If using the optional output terminal for a Position Transmitter or Switch output, this must
be enabled with a user interface tool such as ValveLink software.
 Function—The output terminals can be configured as one of the following:
Transmitter - 4­20 mA output that represents 0­100% of the calibrated valve travel.
Limit Switch - Discrete switch (1A max) that trips at a configurable point within 0­100% of calibrated valve travel.
Alert Switch - Discrete switch (1A max) that trips based on a configurable device alert.
 Fail Signal—Should the output circuit fail to operate properly, the output will attempt to drive to a known state.
Depending on the nature of the failure, the circuit may or may not be able to achieve this fail state. When
configured as a position transmitter, the output can be configured to fail low (< 3.6 mA). The output can be
configured to fail high (> 22.5 mA) when the digital valve controller is powered. When configured as a switch, the
output can be configured to drive Closed or Open.
Note
On loss of digital valve controller power, the switch circuit will always go to the open state.
Switch Configuration
Note
Switch Configuration is only available on units that have the optional 4­20 mA position transmitter or switch hardware installed.
 Limit Switch Trip Point—When the function is configured as a Limit Switch, this defines the threshold for the limit
switch in percent of calibrated travel.
 Alert Switch Source—When the function is configured as a Alert Switch, this determines which alert will activate the
switch. The alert choices are: Travel Deviation or Pressure Fallback.

Transmitter Output is only available on units that have the optional 4­20 mA position transmitter or switch hardware installed.
This configures the relationship between the valve travel and the position transmitter output signal. There are two
choices; 4mA = Valve Closed or 4mA = Valve Open.
Burst Mode
Burst mode provides continuous communication from the digital valve controller. Burst mode applies only to the
transmission of burst mode data (HART Variable Assignments) and does not affect the way other data is accessed.

Note
Access to information in the instrument is normally obtained through the poll/response of HART communication. The handheld
communicator or the control system may request any of the information that is normally available, even while the instrument is in
burst mode. Between each burst mode transmission sent by the instrument, a short pause allows the handheld communicator or
control system to initiate a request. The instrument receives the request, processes the response message, and then continues
“bursting” the burst mode data.
Burst mode will be automatically disabled during diagnostics tests such as Valve Signature.
HART 7 allows three burst commands to be reported. When using a Tri-Loop, do not enable the 2nd or 3rd burst commands. These
additional commands will result in missed messages, thus taking the Tri-Loop's output to the fault state.
Note
If the instrument is configured to operate in pressure control mode, or detects an invalid travel sensor reading, the Travel variable
will report pressure in percent of bench set range.
Alert Setup
Handheld Communicator Configure > Alert Setup (2‐3)
An alert is a notification that the instrument has detected a problem. Alerts that are enabled and active will be
recorded in the instrument memory within the Alert Record (see Section 5). Some alerts are also defined in the HART
Command 48 response structure which is can be read by any HART communicating host system (refer to the HART
Field Device Specification, D103639X012).
Certain critical alerts can be configured to shut down the device when active (i.e. latch in the Zero Power Condition).
This can be enabled or disabled for each applicable alert. The default shutdown setting is disabled. To clear the
shutdown, correct the problem and then cycle power to the instrument (or disable the alert).
Alerts may be enabled or disabled with the instrument In Service, Out of Service, Protection On, or Protection Off.
However, shutdown alerts can only be enabled or disabled while Protection is off.
For a detailed explanation of the alerts and the recommended actions, refer to Section 5.

When a DVC6200 digital valve controller is ordered as part of a control valve assembly, the factory mounts the digital
valve controller on the actuator and connects the necessary tubing, then sets up and calibrates the controller.
For digital valve controllers that are ordered separately, recalibration of the analog input or pressure sensors generally
is unnecessary. However, after mounting on an actuator, perform the initial setup then calibrate travel by selecting
Configure > Calibration > Travel Calibration > Auto Calibration. For more detailed calibration information, refer to the
following calibration procedures.

PST Calibration (ODV Instrument Level only) - see page 47
Note
The Instrument Mode must be Out Of Service and the Protection set to None before the instrument can be calibrated.
If you are operating in burst mode, we recommend that you disable burst before continuing with calibration. Once calibration is
complete, burst mode may then be turned back on.
 WARNING
During calibration the valve will move full stroke. To avoid personal injury and property damage caused by the release of
pressure or process fluid, isolate the valve from the process and equalize pressure on both sides of the valve or bleed off the
process fluid.

Travel Calibration
If a double‐acting relay is used, you will be prompted to run the relay adjustment when auto or manual calibration is
selected. Select Yes to adjust the relay, select No to proceed with calibration. For additional information, refer to Relay
Adjustment on page 45.
Auto Calibration
1. The auto calibration procedure is automatic. It is completed when the Calibration menu appears.
During calibration, the instrument seeks the high and low end points and the minor loop feedback (MLFB) and output
bias. By searching for the end points, the instrument establishes the limits of physical travel, i.e. the actual travel 0 and
100% positions. This also determines how far the relay beam swings to calibrate the sensitivity of the MLFB sensor.
2. Place the instrument In Service and verify that the travel properly tracks the current source.
If the unit does not calibrate, refer to table 4‐1 for error messages and possible remedies.
Table 4‐1. Auto Calibrate Travel Error Messages
Error Message Possible Problem and Remedy

Pushbutton Calibration
A pushbutton near the wiring terminals in the terminal box provides a quick means to autocalibrate the instrument.
The button must be pressed for 3 to 10 seconds. Autocalibration will move the valve through the full range of travel
whether the Instrument Mode is In Service or Out of Service. However, if the Write Protection is Protected, this button
will not be active. To abort, press the button again for 1 second. The calibration button is disabled by default. To
enable it, go to Manual Setup > Instrument > Calibration Button.
Note
Pressure range (used for Pressure Fallback) is not recalibrated during this procedure.
This calibration procedure is recommended whenever the I/P converter or pneumatic relay is replaced. Do not use the
pushbutton calibration for initial calibration when mounting the instrument on an actuator, or if the printed wiring
board assembly was replaced.
If you suspect calibration has changed due to drift, first perform a Valve Signature diagnostic test using ValveLink
software to capture the as­found data for future root cause analysis.

active, replace the printed wiring board assembly.
Supply Pressure High is active if the supply pressure falls above the supply pressure high alert point.
Supply Pressure Low is active if the supply pressure falls below the supply pressure low alert point.
Temperature Sensor Failure is active when the instrument temperature sensor fails, or the sensor reading is outside of
the range of -60 to 100°C (-76 to 212°F). The temperature reading is used internally for temperature compensation of
inputs. If this alert is active, restart the instrument. If the alert persists, replace the printed wiring board assembly.
Travel Accumulator High is active if the Travel Accumulator exceeds the Travel Accumulator Alert Point. The Travel
Accumulator totalizes the travel of the valve when the deadband is exceeded. To clear the alert, set the Travel
Accumulator to a value less than the alert point. See figure 5‐2.
Travel Alert Hi is active when the Travel exceeds the Travel Alert Hi Point. Once the alert is active, the alert will clear
when the Travel falls below the Travel Alert Hi Point minus the Travel Alert Deadband. See figure 5‐1.
Note
The Travel Alert Hi Hi and Travel Alert Lo Lo points are used to calculate the stroke time in the event of a demand. The values are
typically set to 99% and 1% respectively, however it is not necessary to enable the alert. Stroke time can be read from the device
with ValveLink software.
Travel Alert Hi-Hi is active when the Travel exceeds the Travel Alert Hi Hi Point. Once the alert is active, the alert will
clear when the Travel falls below the Travel Alert Hi Hi Point minus the Travel Alert Deadband. See figure 5‐1.
Travel Alert Lo is active when the Travel is below the Travel Alert Lo Point. Once the alert is active, the alert will clear
when the Travel exceeds the Travel Alert Lo Point plus the Travel Alert Deadband. See figure 5‐1.
Travel Alert Lo-Lo is active when the Travel is below the Travel Alert Lo Point. Once the alert is active, the alert will clear

Travel Limit/Cutoff Hi is active when the Travel exceeds the Hi Limit/Cutoff Point.
Travel Limit/Cutoff Lo is active when the Travel falls below the Lo Limit/Cutoff Point.
Travel Deviation— If the difference between the Travel Target and the Travel exceeds the Travel Deviation Alert Point
for more than the Travel Deviation Time, the Travel Deviation Alert is active. It remains active until the difference
between the travel target and the Travel is less than the Travel Deviation Alert Point minus the Travel Alert Deadband.
See figure 5‐1.
Travel Sensor Failure is active if the sensed travel is outside the range of 25.0 to 125.0% of calibrated travel. If this alert
is active, check the instrument mounting. Also, check that the electrical connection from the travel sensor is properly
plugged into the printed wiring board assembly. After restarting the instrument, if the alert persists, troubleshoot the
printed wiring board assembly or travel sensor.
Variable out of Range is active if one or more of the measured analog sensor readings (loop current, pressure,
temperature, or travel) is saturated or reading out of its configured range. The condition may be due to improper
configuration or physical setup and not be due to a sensor malfunction.
Deadband Principle of Operation
The deadband is the percent (%) of ranged travel around a travel reference point where no change in alert status will
occur. This prevents the alert from toggling on and off when operating near the alert point.

The Travel Alert Deadband applies to the Travel Deviation Alert as well as the Travel Alert Hi, Lo, Hi Hi, and Lo Lo.
Figure 5‐1 illustrates the principle behind setting and clearing a Travel Alert Hi. The alert is set when the travel exceeds
the alert point, and is cleared when it falls below the deadband.

Partial Stroke Test
Note
Partial Stroke Test is only available for instrument level ODV.
The Partial Stroke Test allows DVC6200 digital valve controllers with instrument level ODV to perform a Valve
Signature type of test while the instrument is in service and operational. In some applications, it is important to be able
to exercise and test the valve to verify that it will operate when commanded. This feature allows the user to partially
stroke the valve while continually monitoring the input signal. If a demand arises, the test is aborted and the valve
moves to its commanded position. The partial stroke valve travel is configurable between 1 and 30% maximum travel,
in 0.1% increments. Data from the last partial stroke test is stored in the instrument memory for retrieval by ValveLink
software.
The Partial Stroke Test allows you to perform a partial, 10%, stroke test (standard) or a custom stroke test. With the
custom stroke test, the stroke may be extended up to 30%. Be sure to check plant guidelines before performing a
custom stroke test. The purpose of this test is to ensure that the valve assembly moves upon demand.
A partial stroke test can be initiated when the valve is operating at either 4 or 20 mA (point‐to‐point mode).
When enabled, a partial stroke test may be initiated by the device (as a scheduled, auto partial stroke test), a remote
pushbutton located in the field or at the valve, a handheld communicator, or ValveLink software.
For information on configuring the Partial Stroke Test, see Partial Stroke Variables in the Detailed Setup section.
 Automatic (Scheduled)
The Auto Partial Stroke Test allows the partial stroke test to be scheduled by the DVC6200. The test is scheduled in
number of hours between tests. Any power cycle will reset the test clock timer.
 Local Pushbutton
A partial stroke test command may be sent to the digital valve controller using a set of contacts wired to the auxiliary
+/- terminals. To perform a test, the contacts must be closed for 3 to 5 seconds and then opened. To abort the test,

close the contacts for 1 second. The last set of diagnostic data is stored in the instrument memory for later retrieval via
ValveLink software.
 Handheld Communicator
1. Connect the handheld communicator to the LOOP terminals on the digital valve controller.
2. Turn on the handheld communicator.
3. From the Online menu, select Service Tools > Diagnostics > Partial Stroke Test.
4. Select either Standard (10%) or Custom. With the Custom Stroke Test, the stroke may be entered up to 30% with
configurable stroking speed and pause time.
5. The currently configured Stroke, Stroking Speed, and Pause Time is displayed. Choose “Yes” to run the test using
these values. Choose “No” to modify the values. The default value for Stroke Speed is 0.25%/second.
6. The valve begins to move and the actual travel reported by the digital valve controller is displayed on the handheld
communicator.
7. Once the valve has reached the endpoint, check that the valve has reached the desired set point. The valve should
return to its original position.
 ValveLink Software
Run the Partial Stroke diagnostic.
Solenoid Valve Health Monitoring
Solenoid valve health monitoring requires the following setup:
 Single-acting actuator
 Solenoid valve installed between the DVC6200 pressure output and the actuator
 Unused output pressure port of the DVC6200 connected between the solenoid and the actuator, close to the
actuator
 Relay configured as “special application”
 Triggered profile enabled and the “Pressure Differential” trigger event selected.
If the solenoid valve is wired directly to the logic solver, the following steps can be used to test the solenoid valve.
1. Momentarily interrupt the power to the solenoid valve through the Logic Solver (typically 100 to 200 milliseconds).
The duration of the interruption should be short enough so that the safety valve travel does not move, but long
enough to so that a pressure drop across the solenoid valve is detected.
2. Properly configured, data collection will occur automatically and will be stored onboard the DVC6200.
3. With ValveLink software, upload the diagnostic data from the triggered profile menu.
4. Examine the graph and observe that there was a change in the pressure reading downstream of the solenoid.

Section 6 Maintenance and Troubleshooting66
The DVC6200 digital valve controller enclosure is rated Type 4X and IP66, therefore periodic cleaning of internal
components is not required. If the DVC6200 is installed in an area where the exterior surfaces tend to get heavily
coated or layered with industrial or atmospheric contaminants, it is recommended that the vent (key 52) be
periodically removed and inspected to ensure there is no partial or full obstruction. If the vent appears to be partially or
fully obstructed, it must be cleaned or replaced. Lightly brush the exterior of the vent to remove contaminants and run
a mild water/detergent solution through the vent to ensure it is free of any obstruction. Allow the vent to dry before
reinstalling.
 WARNING
Personal injury or property damage can occur from cover failure due to overpressure. Ensure that the housing vent
opening is open and free of debris to prevent pressure buildup under the cover.
 WARNING
To avoid static discharge from the plastic cover when flammable gases or dust are present, do not rub or clean the cover
with solvents. To do so could result in a spark that may cause the flammable gases or dust to explode, resulting in personal
injury or property damage. Clean with a mild detergent and water only.
 WARNING
Avoid personal injury or property damage from sudden release of process pressure or bursting of parts. Before performing
any maintenance procedures on the DVC6200 digital valve controller:
 Always wear protective clothing, gloves, and eyewear.
 Do not remove the actuator from the valve while the valve is still pressurized.
 Disconnect any operating lines providing air pressure, electric power, or a control signal to the actuator. Be sure the
actuator cannot suddenly open or close the valve.
 Use bypass valves or completely shut off the process to isolate the valve from process pressure. Relieve process pressure
from both sides of the valve.
 Use lock‐out procedures to be sure that the above measures stay in effect while you work on the equipment.
 Check with your process or safety engineer for any additional measures that must be taken to protect against process
media.
 Vent the pneumatic actuator loading pressure and relieve any actuator spring precompression so the actuator is not
applying force to the valve stem; this will allow for the safe removal of the stem connector.
 WARNING
When using natural gas as the supply medium, or for explosion proof applications, the following warnings also apply:
 Remove electrical power before removing the housing cap. Personal injury or property damage from fire or explosion
may result if power is not disconnected before removing the cap.
 Remove electrical power before disconnecting any of the pneumatic connections.
Instruction Manual
D103605X012
Maintenance and Troubleshooting

Appendix A Principle of OperationAA−A
HART Communication
The HART (Highway Addressable Remote Transducer) protocol gives field devices the capability of communicating
instrument and process data digitally. This digital communication occurs over the same two‐wire loop that provides
the 4‐20 mA process control signal, without disrupting the process signal. In this way, the analog process signal, with
its faster update rate, can be used for control. At the same time, the HART protocol allows access to digital diagnostic,
maintenance, and additional process data. The protocol provides total system integration via a host device.
The HART protocol uses frequency shift keying (FSK). Two individual frequencies of 1200 and 2200 Hz are
superimposed over the 4‐20 mA current signal. These frequencies represent the digits 1 and 0 (see figure A‐1). By
superimposing a frequency signal over the 4-20 mA current, digital communication is attained. The average value of
the HART signal is zero, therefore no DC value is added to the 4‐20 mA signal. Thus, true simultaneous communication
is achieved without interrupting the process signal.

The HART protocol allows the capability of multidropping, i.e., networking several devices to a single communications
line. This process is well suited for monitoring remote applications such as pipelines, custody transfer sites, and tank
farms. See table 6‐2 for instructions on changing the printed wiring board DIP switch configuration to multidrop.
DVC6200 Digital Valve Controller
The DVC6200 digital valve controller housing contains the travel sensor, terminal box, pneumatic input and output
connections and a module base that may be easily replaced in the field without disconnecting field wiring or tubing.
The module base contains the following submodules: I/P converter, printed wiring board (pwb) assembly, and
pneumatic relay. The relay position is detected by sensing the magnet on the relay beam via a detector on the printed
wiring board. This sensor is used for the minor loop feedback (MLFB) reading. The module base can be rebuilt by
replacing the submodules. See figures A‐3, A‐4, A‐5, and A‐6.

CONTROL SYSTEM
HART MODEM
E1362
DVC6200 digital valve controllers are loop‐powered instruments that provide a control valve position proportional to
an input signal from the control room. The following describes a double‐acting digital valve controller mounted on a
piston actuator.
The input signal is routed into the terminal box through a single twisted pair of wires and then to the printed wiring
board assembly submodule where it is read by the microprocessor, processed by a digital algorithm, and converted
into an analog I/P drive signal.
As the input signal increases, the drive signal to the I/P converter increases, increasing the I/P output pressure. The I/P
output pressure is routed to the pneumatic relay submodule. The relay is also connected to supply pressure and
amplifies the small pneumatic signal from the I/P converter. The relay accepts the amplified pneumatic signal and
provides two output pressures. With increasing input (4 to 20 mA signal), the output A pressure always increases and
the output B pressure decreases. The output A pressure is used for double‐acting and single‐acting direct applications.
The output B pressure is used for double‐acting and single‐acting reverse applications. As shown in figure A‐3, A‐4, and
A‐5 the increased output A pressure causes the actuator stem to move downward. Stem position is sensed by the
non‐contact travel feedback sensor. The stem continues to move downward until the correct stem position is
attained. At this point the printed wiring board assembly stabilizes the I/P drive signal. This positions the flapper to
prevent any further increase in nozzle pressure.
As the input signal decreases, the drive signal to the I/P converter submodule decreases, decreasing the I/P output
pressure. The pneumatic relay decreases the output A pressure and increases the output B pressure. The stem moves
upward until the correct position is attained. At this point the printed wiring board assembly stabilizes the I/P drive
signal. This positions the flapper to prevent any further decrease in nozzle pressure.

Configuration
Stored instructions and operating parameters for
a FIELDVUE Instrument.
Control Loop
An arrangement of physical and electronic
components for process control. The electronic
components of the loop continuously measure
one or more aspects of the process, then alter
those aspects as necessary to achieve a desired
process condition. A simple control loop
measures only one variable. More sophisticated
control loops measure many variables and
maintain specified relationships among those
variables.
Control Mode
Defines where the instrument reads its set point.
The following control modes are available for a
FIELDVUE Instrument:
Analog The instrument receives its travel set
point over the 4‐20 mA loop.
Digital The instrument receives its set point
digitally, via the HART communications link.
Test This is not a user‐selectable mode. The
handheld communicator or ValveLink software
places the instrument in this mode whenever it
needs to move the valve, such as for calibration or
diagnostic tests.
Control Mode, Restart
Determines the instrument control mode after a
restart. See Control Mode for the available restart
control modes.
Controller
A device that operates automatically to regulate a
controlled variable.
Current‐to‐Pressure (I/P) Converter
An electronic component or device that converts
a milliamp signal to a proportional pneumatic
pressure output signal.
Cycle Counter
The capability of a FIELDVUE instrument to record
the number of times the travel changes direction.
The change in direction must occur after the
deadband has been exceeded before it can be
counted as a cycle.

Cycle Counter Alert
Checks the difference between the Cycle Counter
and the Cycle Counter Alert Point. Cycle Counter
Alert is active when the cycle counter value
exceeds the Cycle Counter Alert Point. It clears
after you reset the Cycle Counter to a value less
than the alert point.
Cycle Counter Alert Point
An adjustable value which, when exceeded,
activates the Cycle Counter Alert. Valid entries
are 0 to 4 billion cycles.
Cycle Counter Deadband
Region around the travel reference point, in
percent of ranged travel, established at the last
increment of the Cycle Counter. The deadband
must be exceeded before a change in travel can
be counted as a cycle. Valid entries are 0% to
100%. Typical value is between 2% and 5%.
Deviation
Usually, the difference between set point and
process variable. More generally, any departure
from a desired or expected value or pattern.
Device ID
Unique identifier embedded in the instrument at
the factory.
Device Revision
Revision number of the interface software that
permits communication between the handheld
communicator and the instrument.
Drive Signal

increments of valve stem travel produce equal
percentage changes in existing flow. One of the
input characteristics available for a FIELDVUE
Instrument. See also, Linear and Quick Opening.
Feedback Signal
Indicates to the instrument the actual position of
the valve. The travel sensor provides the feedback
signal to the instrument printed wiring board
assembly.
Firmware Revision
The revision number of the instrument firmware.
Firmware is a program that is entered into the
instrument at time of manufacture and cannot be
changed by the user.
Free Time
Percent of time that the microprocessor is idle. A
typical value is 25%. The actual value depends on
the number of functions in the instrument that
are enabled and on the amount of
communication currently in progress.
Full Ranged Travel
Current, in mA, that corresponds with the point
where ranged travel is maximum, i.e., limited by
the mechanical travel stops.
Gain
The ratio of output change to input change.
Hardware Revision

HART (acronym)
The acronym HART stands for Highway
Addressable Remote Transducer.
HART Universal Revision
Revision number of the HART Universal
Commands which are the communications
protocol for the instrument.
Input Characteristic
The relationship between the ranged travel and
ranged input. Possible values include: linear,
equal percentage, and quick opening.
Input Current
The current signal from the control system that
serves as the analog input to the instrument. See
also Input Signal.
Input Range

the travel range.
Input Signal
The current signal from the control system. The
input signal can be displayed in milliamperes or in
percent of ranged input.
Instrument Level
Determines the functions available for the
instrument. See table 5‐1.
Instrument Mode
Determines if the instrument responds to its
analog input signal. There are two instrument
modes:
In Service: For a fully functioning instrument, the
instrument output changes in response to analog
input changes. Typically changes to setup or
calibration cannot be made when the instrument
mode is In Service.
Out of Service: The instrument output does not
change in response to analog input changes
when the instrument mode is Out of Service.
Some setup parameters can be changed only
when the instrument mode is Out of Service.
Instrument Protection
Determines if commands from a HART device can
calibrate and/or configure certain parameters in
the instrument. There are two types of
instrument protection:
Configuration and Calibration: Prohibits changing
protected setup parameters; prohibits
calibration.
None: Permits both configuration and calibration.
The instrument is ”unprotected.”
Instrument Serial Number
The serial number assigned to the printed wiring
board by the factory but can be changed during
setup. The instrument serial number should
match the serial number on the instrument
nameplate.
Leak Class
Defines the allowable leakage by a valve when it is
closed. Leak class numbers are listed in two
standards: ANSI/FCI 70‐2 and IEC 534‐4.
Linear
A valve flow characteristic where changes in flow
rate are directly proportional to changes in valve
stem travel. One of the input characteristics
available for a FIELDVUE Instrument. See also,
Equal Percentage and Quick Opening.
Linearity, dynamic
Linearity (independent) is the maximum
deviation from a straight line best fit to the
opening and closing curves and a line
representing the average value of those curves.
Memory

Minimum Closing Time
Minimum time, in seconds, for the travel to
decrease through the entire ranged travel. This
rate is applied to any travel decrease. Valid entries
are 0 to 400 seconds. Deactivate by entering a
value of 0 seconds.
Minimum Opening Time
Minimum time, in seconds, for the travel to
increase through the entire ranged travel. This
rate is applied to any travel increase. Because of
friction, actual valve travel may not respond in
exactly the same time frame. Valid entries are 0
to 400 seconds. Deactivate by entering a value of
0 seconds.
Non‐Volatile Memory (NVM)
A type of semiconductor memory that retains its
contents even though power is disconnected.
NVM contents can be changed during
configuration unlike ROM which can be changed
only at time of instrument manufacture. NVM
stores configuration restart data.
Parallel
Simultaneous: said of data transmission on two or
more channels at the same time.
Polling Address
Address of the instrument. If the digital valve
controller is used in a point‐to‐point
configuration, set the polling address to 0. If it is
used in a multidrop configuration, or split range
application, set the polling address to a value
from 0 to 15 for HART 5 and 0 to 63 for HART 7.
Pressure Sensor
A FIELDVUE instrument internal device that
senses pneumatic pressure. The DVC6200 has
three pressure sensors: one to sense supply
pressure and two to sense the output pressures.
Primary Master
Masters are communicating devices. A primary
master is a communicating device permanently
wired to a field instrument. Typically, a
HART‐compatible control system or a computer
running ValveLink software is the primary master.
In contrast, a secondary master is not often
permanently wired to a field instrument. The
handheld communicator or a computer running
ValveLink software communicating through a
HART modem could be considered a secondary
master.
Note: If one type of master takes an instrument
Out Of Service, the same type must put it In
Service. For example, if a device set up as a
primary master takes an instrument Out Of
Service, a device set up as a primary master must
be used to place the instrument In Service.
Quick Opening
A valve flow characteristic where most of the
change in flow rate takes place for small amounts
of stem travel from the closed position. The flow
characteristic curve is basically linear through the
first 40 percent of stem travel. One of the input
characteristics available for a FIELDVUE
Instrument. See also, Equal Percentage and
Linear.
Random Access Memory (RAM)
A type of semiconductor memory that is normally
used by the microprocessor during normal
operation that permits rapid retrieval and storage
of programs and data. See also Read Only
Memory (ROM) and Non‐Volatile Memory (NVM).
Rate
Amount of change in output proportional to the
rate of change in input.
Read‐Only Memory (ROM)
A memory in which information is stored at the
time of instrument manufacture. You can
examine but not change ROM contents.
Seat Load
Force exerted on the valve seat, typically
expressed in pounds force per lineal inch of port
circumference. Seat load is determined by shutoff
requirements.

Set Point Filter Time (Lag Time)
The time constant, in seconds, for the first‐order
input filter. The default of 0 seconds will bypass
the filter.
Software
Microprocessor or computer programs and
routines that reside in alterable memory (usually
RAM), as opposed to firmware, which consists of
programs and routines that are programmed into
memory (usually ROM) when the instrument is
manufactured. Software can be manipulated
during normal operation, firmware cannot.
Stroking Time
The time, in seconds, required to move the valve
from its fully open position to fully closed, or vice
versa.
Temperature Sensor
A device within the FIELDVUE instrument that
measures the instrument's internal temperature.
Travel
Movement of the valve stem or shaft which
changes the amount the valve is open or closed.
Travel Accumulator
The capability of a FIELDVUE instrument to record
total change in travel. The value of the Travel
Accumulator increments when the magnitude of
the change exceeds the Travel Accumulator
Deadband. To reset the Travel Accumulator, set it
to zero.
Travel Accumulator Alert
Checks the difference between the Travel
Accumulator value and the Travel Accumulator
Alert Point. The Travel Accumulator Alert is active
when the Travel Accumulator value exceeds the
Travel Accumulator Alert Point. It clears after you
reset the Travel Accumulator to a value less than
the alert point.
Travel Accumulator Alert Point
An adjustable value which, when exceeded,
activates the Travel Accumulator Alert. Valid
entries are 0% to 4 billion %.
Travel Accumulator Deadband
Region around the travel reference point
established at the last increment of the
accumulator. This region must be exceeded
before a change in travel can be accumulated.
Valid entries are 0% to 100%.
Travel Alert
Checks the ranged travel against the travel high
and low alert points. The travel alert is active if
either the high or low point is exceeded. Once a
high or low point is exceeded, the ranged travel
must clear that point by the Travel Alert
Deadband before the alert clears. Four travel
alerts are available: Travel Alert Hi, Travel Alert Lo,
Travel Alert Hi Hi, and Travel Alert Lo Lo.
Travel Alert Deadband
Travel, in percent of ranged travel, required to
clear a travel alert, once it is active. Valid entries
are -25% to 125%.
Travel Alert High Point
Value of the travel, in percent of ranged travel,
which, when exceeded, sets the Travel Alert Hi
alert. Valid entries are -25% to 125%.
Travel Alert High High Point
Value of the travel, in percent of ranged travel,
which, when exceeded, sets the Travel Alert Hi Hi
alert. Valid entries are -25% to 125%.
Travel Alert Low Point
Value of the travel, in percent of ranged travel,
which, when exceeded, sets the Travel Alert Lo
alert. Valid entries are -25% to 125%.
Travel Alert Low Low Point
Value of the travel, in percent of ranged travel,
which, when exceeded, sets the Travel Alert Lo Lo
alert. Valid entries are -25% to 125%.
Travel Cutoff
Defines the cutoff point for the travel, in percent
of ranged travel. There are two travel cutoffs:
high and low. Once travel exceeds the cutoff, the
drive signal is set to either maximum or
minimum, depending on the Zero Control Signal
and if the cutoff is high or low. Minimum opening
time or minimum closing time are not in effect
while the travel is beyond the cutoff. Use the
travel cutoff to obtain the desired seat load or to
be sure the valve is fully open.

Travel Deviation
The difference between the analog input signal
(in percent of ranged input), the “target” travel,
and the actual “ranged” travel.
Travel Deviation Alert
Checks the difference between the target and the
ranged travel. If the difference exceeds the Travel
Deviation Alert Point for more than the Travel
Deviation Time, the Travel Deviation Alert is
active. It remains active until the difference is less
than the Travel Deviation Alert Point.
Travel Deviation Alert Point
An adjustable value for the target travel and the
ranged travel difference, expressed in percent,
When this value is exceeded by the travel
deviation for more than the Travel Deviation
Time, the Travel Deviation Alert is active. Valid
entries are 0% to 100%. Typically this is set to 5%.
Travel Deviation Time
The time, in seconds. that the travel deviation
must exceed the Travel Deviation Alert Point
before the alert is active. Valid entries are 1 to 60
seconds.
Travel Limit
A setup parameter that defines the maximum
allowable travel (in percent of ranged travel) for
the valve. During operation, the travel target will
not exceed this limit. There are two travel limits:
high and low. Typically the travel limit low will be
used to keep the valve from going completely
closed.
Travel Range
Travel, in percent of calibrated travel, that
corresponds to the input range.
Travel Sensor
A device within the FIELDVUE instrument that
senses valve stem or shaft movement. The travel
sensor in the DVC6200 is the Hall Effect sensor
that measures the position of the magnetic
assembly.
Travel Sensor Motion
Increasing or decreasing air pressure causes the
magnet assembly to move up or down or the
rotary shaft to turn clockwise or
counterclockwise. The Setup Wizard asks if it can
move the valve to determine travel.
Tuning
The adjustment of control terms or parameter
values to produce a desired control effect.
Tuning Set
Preset values that identify gain settings for a
FIELDVUE instrument. The tuning set and supply
pressure together determine an instrument's
response to input signal changes.
Watch Dog Timer
A timer that the microprocessor must rearm
periodically. If the microprocessor is unable to
rearm the timer, the instrument goes through
reset.
Zero Power Condition
The position of the valve (open or closed) when
the electrical power to the instrument is
removed. Zero Power Condition (ZPC) is
determined by relay and actuator action as
follows:
Single Acting Direct (Relay C) Upon loss of
electrical power instrument goes to zero air
output at port A.
Double Acting (Relay A) Upon loss of electrical
power instrument goes to full supply air output at
port B. A goes to zero air output.
Single Acting Reverse (Relay B) Upon loss of
electrical power instrument goes to full supply air
output at Port B.
