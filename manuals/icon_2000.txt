2 STORAGE AND
PRE-INSTALLATION
2.1 TESTS TO BE CARRIED OUT WHEN THE
ACTUATOR IS RECEIVED
If the actuator is received already mounted
on the valve, all operations should have
already been performed during valve/actuator
assembly.
• Check that the display is active.
• Turn the handwheel until the valve is in a
completely open position.
• Check that the display reads 100% indicating
that the valve is completely open.
• Rotate the handwheel clockwise and bring
the valve to a completely closed position.
• Check that the display reads 0% indicating
that the valve is completely closed.
If the test result is satisfactory, the actuator
has already been adjusted and you can proceed
with the electrical connection.
If the actuator is delivered separately from the
valve, or the above procedure shows that the
position is incorrect, all operations described in
this manual must be carried out.
• Check that no damage has occurred during
transport, especially to the push-buttons, the
display area glass and the selector.
• Check the information on the nameplate:
serial number and performance data
(nominal torque, operation speed, protection
class, motor supply voltage, etc.), and verify
the corresponding data on the display
(see chapter 10, View routines).
Make sure all accessories have been received
with the shipment, as described in the delivery
documentation.
2.2 STORAGE PROCEDURE
IMPORTANT
Not performing the following procedures will
invalidate the product guarantee.
2.2.1 General
The actuator leaves the factory in perfect
condition, as guaranteed by an individual
test certificate. In order to maintain these
characteristics until the actuator is installed
on site, proper procedures must be taken for
preservation during the storage period.
Biffi actuators are weatherproof to IP66/68.
This condition can only be maintained if the
units are correctly installed/connected on site
and if they have been correctly stored.
The standard plastic plugs used to close the
cable entries are not weatherproof, they just
prevent the entry of undesired objects during
transport.
2.2.2 Storage for a brief period
(less than one year)
2.2.2.1 Indoor storage
• Make sure that the actuators are kept in a dry
place, laid on a wooden pallet and protected
from dust.
2.2.2.2 Outdoor storage
• Make sure that the actuators are protected
from the direct action of weather agents
(protection by a canvas tarp or similar cover).
• Place the actuators on a wooden pallet, or
some other raised platform, so that they are
not in direct contact with the ground.
• If the actuators are supplied with standard
plastic plugs, remove them from the cable
entries and replace them with weatherproof
plugs.
2.2.3 Long period storage
(more than one year)
2.2.3.1 Indoor storage
(In addition to the instructions at
paragraph 2.2.2.1)
• If the actuators are supplied with standard
plastic plugs, replace them with weatherproof
plugs.
• In case the actuator is provided with a lithium
battery, remove it and store in dry and clean
place (see paragraph 11.3, Maintenance -
Lithium battery change).
2.2.3.2 Outdoor storage
(In addition to paragraph 2.2.2.2)
• Check the general conditions of the actuator,
paying particular attention to the terminal
board and local display glass.
• In case the actuator is provided with a lithium
battery, remove it and store in dry and clean
place (see paragraph 11.3, Maintenance -
Lithium battery change).

2.3 CHECKS TO BE PERFORMED BEFORE
INSTALLATION
• Make sure the valve to be motorized is the
appropriate one for coupling to the actuator.
• The electrical supply cables must be suitable
for the power rating (see the test certificate
that comes with the actuator).
• Gather the right tools for the assembly and
for setting the actuator controls.
If a long storage period has occurred, before
reinstalling the actuator, please:
• Check the status of the O-ring seals.
• Check the installation of the plugs or cable
glands on the cable entries.
• Check whether the enclosure covers or the
actuator body are cracked or broken.
• Check the oil level in the actuator and top up
if necessary.
• Put the batteries back into place
(see paragraph 11.3, Maintenance - Lithium
battery change).

3.4 MOUNTING THE ACTUATOR ONTO THE
VALVE
Lubricate the valve stem.
Thoroughly clean the coupling surfaces of the
valve and actuator flanges, degreasing them
carefully since torque is transmitted by friction.
Lift the actuator with slings suitable for its
weight.
The actuator will operate satisfactorily in any
position. When mounted upside down, the end
of the stem cover tube should be drilled Ø5 mm
to avoid build up of service fluid or rainwater.
3.4.1 Coupling type “A”
Place the actuator vertically on the stem, screw
the threaded bushing of the coupling block on
the valve stem, rotating (normally counterclockwise) until the coupling block and flange
surfaces of the valve are securely in contact.

WARNING
Never use the handwheel to lift the actuator.
3.4.2 Couplings type “B1”, “B2”,”B3” and “B4”
Check the dimensions of the valve mounting
details, paying particular attention to the
protrusions of the valve stem in order to avoid
any axial thrusts to the internal parts of the
actuator or the valve when the screws are
tightened.
Engage the manual operation. Place the
actuator vertically on the valve stem. Carry
out the coupling operations (if necessary with
the help of manual operation); make sure no
mating parts are forced.
3.4.3 Actuator fixing
IMPORTANT
In case the actuator is supplied without stud bolts
and nuts the following materials must be used as
a minimum:
- ISO class 8.8 for studs bolts and nuts
or
- ASTM A 320 Grade L7 (or L7M) for studs bolts
- ASTM A 194 Grade 4 for nuts
Model Tightening torque (Nm)
in order to lift the valve gate from its seat to
avoid (during bolt fixing) excessive axial thrusts
on the internal parts of the valve and of the
actuator.
Depending on the conditions of assembly, it
could be easier to separate the thrust block
from the actuator and mount it onto the
valve yoke.

phases and earth.
3.6 REMOVING THE TERMINAL BOARD
ENCLOSURE
Using a 8 mm Allen key, loosen the four screws
and remove the cover.
3.7 CABLE ENTRIES
The sealing of cables and conduit entries
should be carried out in accordance with
National Standards or the Regulatory
Authorities that have certified the actuators.
This is particularly true for units that are
certified for use in hazardous areas where
the method of sealing must be to an approved
standard, and cable glands, reducers, plugs
and adapters must be approved and separately
certified.
Certified cable entries:
- Standard Rc ISO7/1
(cable entries 2x1”+1x1½”+ (optional) 1x¾”
+ (optional) 1x1¾”)
- Standard ASA/NPT
(cable entries 2x1”+1x1½”+ (optional) 1x¾"
+ (optional) 1x1¾")
- Metric BS 3643
(cable entries 2xM32+1xM40)
- Pg DIN 40430
(cable entries 2xPg21+1xPg29)
Remove the cable entry plugs.
WARNING
- The cable reducers are certified according to
the actuator certification.
- Refer to the actuator drawing.
IMPORTANT
- To prevent any water infiltration through the
line cable conduits, make sure the cable glands
have the minimum protection degree required
by the plant.
- If rigid conduits are used, we suggest placing
a flexible pipe connection between the conduit
and the terminal board.
To guarantee weatherproof and explosionproof
fit, screw the cable glands tightly (at least
5 turns) and block them with a thread sealant.
The use of a thread sealant is necessary in case
of explosionproof and weatherproof application.
If some parts of the cable glands have been
removed while working on the cable entries put
them back into place now to avoid losing the
dismantled parts.
Unused entries:
- For explosionproof construction: unused
entries must be plugged with metal
explosionproof plugs and blocked with a
thread sealant.
- For weatherproof construction: replace the
plastic standard protection plugs supplied
with the actuator with metal plugs.

other than the handwheel and the declutch
lever. Using cheater bars, wheel wrenches, pipe
wrenches, or other such devices on the actuator
handwheel or declutch lever may cause serious
personal injury and/or damage to the actuator or
valve.
5.2 ELECTRICAL OPERATION
Before connecting power to the actuator check
that the voltage is correct and according to the
indications on the nameplate. Wrong power
supply could cause a permanent damage to the
electrical components. Check of phase rotation
is not necessary since the unit is provided with
automatic phase rotation correction. Place
the 3-position selector in OFF and then switch
on the power. Do not operate the actuator
without first checking that the configuration is
according to the required application. Using
the “VIEW and SET-UP” features can do this
(see paragraph 6.4, Local controls - Entering
the set-up mode).

• 4-20 mA analog output
The 4-20 mA output can be configured to
provide a signal proportional to either “position”
or “torque”. The polarity option allows to
reverse the relationship between the position
or torque and the 4-20 mA output signal. See
“VIEW and SET-UP” features (paragraph 9.1.9,
OUT 4-20 mA).
The 4-20 mA output is opto-coupled. It should
be powered by a 20-30 V DC voltage (externally
or internally generated) and the maximum load,
including the cable resistance, should be less
than 300 ohm.
Figure A shows the wiring diagram.

The behaviour in case of loss of main
voltage is different if the power supply of the
4-20 mA output stage is internally or externally
generated:
- Internal power supply (or passive loop):
In case of loss of main voltage the output
4-20 mA drops to 0. The correct output will be
restored when the main voltage returns.
- External power supply (or active loop):
If the actuator is provided with an lithium
battery (or supplied by the auxiliary 24 V DC)
and if the main voltage fails, the output
4-20 mA maintains the last value. If the
actuator is moved by handwheel, the output
4-20 mA will be updated.
If the actuator is not provided with an lithium
battery (or not supplied by the auxiliary
24 V DC) and if the main voltage fails, the
output 4-20 mA maintains the last value.
If the actuator is moved by handwheel, the
output 4-20 mA will not be updated.
• 4-20 mA analog input
The 4-20 mA analog input is the position
request R% signal and is used by the ICON 2000
to position the valve in inching and modulating
actuators. The “POSITIONER” routine
processes the input signal, compares the
present actuator position % with the position
request R% and if the difference is greater than
the dead band, the actuator is driven to reach
the requested position. 4 mA corresponds to
request R% = 0% = valve closed and 20 mA
corresponds to request R% = 100% = valve
open. The relationship between position
and request signals can be reversed by the
“Polarity” function. The 4-20 mA input is
opto-coupled. The input impedance is less than
500 ohm. The loss of the 4-20 mA input signal
is indicated as follows:
- Change-over of the monitor relay
- Alarm LED on

push-buttons work as YES and NO to answer
the prompt (next? OK? view?, change? exit?) of
the alphanumeric display.
In OFF, the OPEN / YES and CLOSE / NO
push-buttons allow to scroll down the menu,
to view and change the actuator configuration
or to scroll the list of variables, status, and
alarms.
In REMOTE, the above push-buttons allow
scrolling the list of variables, status, alarms
and reports but the actuator configuration
cannot be viewed or changed.
- actuator control
- actuator configuration
- actuator status visualisation
The figures on the following pages describe
the function of each component of the local
operator interface.
Three LED’s to indicate the actuator status
according to the following logic:
- green ON/ red OFF: the actuator is stopped in
open position
- green OFF/ red ON: the actuator is stopped in
closed position
- green OFF/ red flashing: the actuator is
running in closing direction
- green flashing/ red OFF: the actuator is
running in opening direction
- green ON/ red ON: the actuator is stopped in
intermediate position
- yellow ON: alarm
- yellow flashing: warning
The above color combination is supplied as
standard, but it may be changed (red with
green, green with red, and yellow with red),
during actuator setting operations.

6.2 CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
The ICON 2000 actuator can be totally
configured from the local interface by means of
a series of menus that can be selected from the
alphanumeric display. The operator is guided
through the different displays by answering
YES or NO to the appropriate prompt (change?
OK?, view?, next?, etc.) in the right corner of the
lower row of the alphanumeric display.
To access the menus: set the local selector in
OFF and then simultaneously press OPEN/YES
and STOP. The alphanumeric display will now
show the present language. Press YES if the
language is correct, press NO to scroll the list
of available languages and then YES to select.
After choosing the language, the next step
is the selection among view and set-up
mode. Use “View” mode to see the actuator
configuration, and use “Set-up” mode to
change the present configuration. Unauthorized
access to the set-up mode is prevented by
a 4-character alphanumeric password. The
actuator is supplied by Biffi with the default
password “0 0 0 0”.
Once the correct password has been entered,
the actuator parameters can be configured.
The present password can also be modified by
the “set password” routine in the Maintenance
menu. After entering the new password, the
old one ceases to be valid, so it is important to
record the password in a secure location for
future retrieval.
The configuration functions (view and set-up
mode) are grouped in 4 main menus:
Actuator set-up, Nameplate, Valve data,
Maintenance.
Nameplate
This menu includes a series of data identifying
the actuator characteristics, service, and
utilisation mode. The data are entered by the
manufacturer and can only be viewed (i.e., this
menu is only available in View mode).
List of routines:
- serial number
- actuator type
- torque/thrust
- actuator speed
- power supply
- motor data
- test date
- wiring diagram
- enclosure
- certificate
- lubricant
- revision
- torque sensor
Valve data
This menu includes a series of data relevant to
the valve. The valve manufacturer and end user
should enter the data.
List of routines:
- tag name (max 28 characters)
- manufacturer (max 28 characters)
- break OP torque (max 28 characters)
- serial number (max 28 characters)
- break CL torque (max 28 characters)
- max stem thrust (max 28 characters)
- flange type (max 28 characters)
Maintenance
This menu includes all diagnostic and historic
data which can help the operator in case of
failure or during maintenance operations.
The Maintenance menu also includes the
“Set password” routine.
List of routines:
• Set-up mode
- set new password
- clear alarm log
- set torque profile reference
- set torque curve reference
- clear recent data log
- set maintenance date
- set data logger
• View mode
- alarm log
- torque profile
- torque curve
- operation log
- maintenance date
- data logger
Actuator set-up
This menu includes the routines that allow
the actuator to be configured according to the
requested control mode and to the valve it is
mounted on.
- stroke limits
- torque set-up
- ESD set-up
- remote controls
- local controls
- output relays
- positioner *
- fail safe *
- out 4-20 mA *
- interlock
- 2-speed timer
- Bus *
- miscellaneous
The routines with * are only available if the
relevant modules are present. If bus interface
is LonWorks, the “BUS” routine changes to
“FDI control”.
The parameters appear on the alphanumeric
display in the same order both in view and
set-up mode. At the end of each routine the
program will automatically return to the
beginning of the routine, and the operator can
choose to either re-enter (by pressing YES) or
to move on to a next routine (by pressing NO).

This routine allows the actuator to be
configured according to the type of valve it is
mounted on.
The following parameters will be set:
- Opening and closing torque limits: from 40%
to 100% of the nominal torque. The nominal
torque corresponding to 100% is set in-house
and is stated in the name plate menu for
reference.
- Close direction: clockwise (CW) or
counter-clockwise (CCW). Most valves require
clockwise rotation of the stem when viewed
from the handwheel. Engage the manual
override and check if the valve closes with
clockwise or counter-clockwise rotation of
the handwheel.
- Close and open limits type: by position or by
torque. Use the table below to choose.
Valve type Close limit Open limit
Gate (solid, flexible and split wedge), globe, metal seated
butterfly valves
Torque Position

Press YES to select the desired option.
• Press either YES or NO to select the signal
type (present, absent).
• Press YES to change ESD priority with
reference to the following signals or status:
- (*) Motor thermostat alarm. Choosing
ESD > THERMOSTAT, the ESD action
will be carried out also in case of
motor over-heating. Vice-versa, if
ESD < THERMOSTAT was chosen, the ESD
action will not be done in case of motor
over-heating.
- (*) Torque limit tripped. Choosing
ESD > TORQUE LIMIT, the ESD action will
be carried out also in case of torque alarm.
Vice-versa, if ESD < TORQUE LIMIT was
chosen, the ESD action will not be done in
case of torque alarm.
- (*) Local stop pressed. Choosing
ESD > LOCAL STOP, the ESD action will
override the local STOP signal. Vice-versa,
if ESD < LOCAL STOP was chosen, the ESD
action will not be performed if the local
STOP push-button is pressed.
The factory configuration is the following:
action: CLOSE, signal type: PRESENT,
priorities: ESD > LOCAL CONTROLS,
ESD > 2-SPEED TIMER, ESD < all other cases.
9.1.3 ESD control
An ESD signal can be connected to the actuator
to override any existing command and drive
the valve to a predetermined position. The ESD
control is not self-maintained: the ESD action
is only performed if the relevant input is active.
The ESD control is active when the 3-position
selector is in REMOTE and no alarm is present.
WARNING
The user may select ESD to override the situations
indicated by (*). If these situations occur and if
“ESD > ...” is configured, the actuator may be
damaged. Therefore, selecting “ESD > ...” will
invalidate the warranty.
Function “ESD priority” allows the ESD
command to override the following additional
situations: (*) motor thermostat alarm,
(*) torque limit tripped, (*) local stop pressed,
3-position selector in local, 2-speed timer,
(*) 3-position selector in OFF.
9.1.4 Remote controls
The actuator may be remotely controlled by 4,
or 3, or 2 wires depending on the connection
made on the terminal board of the actuator.
The following options are available:
- 4 wires latched: requires 2 momentary
signals (since the control is self-maintained)
to open or close and one signal to stop in
mid-travel. The action of the stop signal can
be reversed (stop when signal is On [MAKE]
or stop when signal is Off [BREAK]).
- 3 wires latched instant reverse: requires
2 momentary signals (since the control is
self-maintained) to open or close. Reverse
momentary signal reverses the direction.
- 3 wires momentary: requires 2 push-to-run
type signals (since the control is not
self-maintained) to open or close.
- 2 wires open if signal On: requires signal On
to open and no signal to close.
- 2 wires open if signal Off: requires signal Off
to open and signal On to close.
By selecting the option Off, the remote controls
are disabled.
Configuration should be done during actuator
set-up.
Configuration procedure
• Move the local selector to OFF and then
simultaneously press OPEN and STOP. Select
the language and then enter the password
according to the instructions (see “Entering
the set-up mode”). When the message
displayed is “SET-UP MODE OK?” press
YES. Press YES to select actuator set-up
menu, press NO to scroll the list of available
routines and then press YES to select Remote
controls.
- Local selector in LOCAL. Choosing
ESD > LOCAL CONTROLS, the ESD
action will be carried out also when the
local selector is in LOCAL. Vice-versa, if
ESD < LOCAL CONTROLS was chosen,
the ESD action will not be performed if the
3-position selector is in LOCAL.
- 2-speed timer. Choosing ESD > 2-speed

9.1.7 Positioner
The positioning function is only available in
inching or modulating ICON 2000 actuators
and allows to position the valve according to a
“position request R%” command signal.
The positioning function compares the present
actuator position % with the position request
R%, and if the difference is greater than the
dead band the actuator is driven to reach the
new requested position.
The “position request R%” signal may either be
received from the bus or the 4-20 mA analog
input. If the ICON 2000 is set to receive the
position request R% from the bus, a fieldbus
interface card must be present, or a Hardware
alarm will be generated. If the ICON 2000 is
set to receive the position request R% from
the 4-20 mA generator, the Ain/Aout card
must be present, or a Hardware alarm will be
generated.
The following options can be configured via
local operator interface:
- Dead band: configurable from “position
resolution%” to 25.5% of the maximum
position error. The configured value should be
great enough to avoid the hunting effect.
- Polarity of the 4-20 mA position request
signal: it allows to reverse the relationship
between the 4-20 mA input signal and
the “position request R%”, according to
the following diagrams. The option is not
available when the ICON 2000 is set to receive
the “position request R%” from the bus.
- Motion inhibit time: it allows to adjust the
length of the delay time between two cycles
of the motor. It can be configured from
1 to 255 secs and allows to set the maximum
number of start/hour of the electrical motor.
- % MIN and % MAX, 4-20 mA input signal
range: it allows to change the relationship
between the input signal and the position
request R%. This function is useful when
a single 4-20 mA signal is used to control
the position of 2 valves (e.g.: split range
applications). The option is not available when
the ICON 2000 is set to receive the “position
request R%” from the bus.

• Press NO to move on to “Warnings view?” and
then YES to scroll the list of warnings.
10.4.2 Torque profile
The torque profile routine gives important
information on the actuator working conditions
in comparison with a previously memorized
reference profile. It can give an indication of a
change in the process conditions.
Details are given of the reference and latest
torque expressed in % of the nominal torque.
At the end of a full stroke in opening or closing
the ICON 2000 stores the 3 maximum torque
values in position intervals 0%-10%, 10%-90%,
90%-100% in opening, and the 3 maximum
torque values in position intervals 100%-90%,
90%-10%, 10%-0% in closing. Time and date
of strokes are also saved. The above data are
updated at the end of every full valve stroke and
the previous ones are lost. Function “set torque
reference”, in the SET-UP MENU, Maintenance,
(chapter 7), allows to save the “torque profile”
data in the “torque profile reference” with date
and time. The “torque profile reference” will not
be updated until a new “set torque reference”
command is entered. The user can compare
the last torque profile relevant to the last valve
stroke with the torque profile reference saved
before.
The following definitions will be used:
- Breakout: maximum torque % in position
interval 0-10% in opening or 100%-90% in
closing = max. % of torque to unseat the valve.
- Peak running: maximum torque % in position
interval 10-90% in opening or 90%-10% in
closing = max. % of torque when the valve
runs from Breakout to Ending (maximum
mid-travel).
- Ending: maximum torque % in position
interval 90-100% in opening or 10%-0% in
closing = max. % of torque to seat the valve.
10.4.3 Torque curve
The torque curve routine gives important
information on the actuator working conditions
in comparison with a previously memorized
reference torque curve. It can be used to
perform a detailed analysis of a change in the
process conditions.
During a full valve stroke in opening or closing,
the ICON 2000 measures the torque values
relevant to every 1% of position variation. At
the end of the stroke the collected 101 values
(one torque value every 1% of position change)
are saved in the ICON 2000 memory together
with the time and date of strokes, main voltage,
motor temperature, temperature inside the
electronics compartment and temperature
inside the terminal board compartment. Up to
100 curves in opening and 100 curves in closing
can be saved. When a new curve is available
the oldest one is cancelled and the new one
is memorized. The above data are updated at
the end of every full valve stroke. Data relevant
to a partial stroke are discharged. Function
“set curve reference”, in the SET-UP MENU,
Maintenance, chapter 7, allows to save the full
set of data relevant to 1 off 100 “torque curves”
in the “torque curve reference”. The “torque
curve reference” will not be updated until a new
“set curve reference” command is entered.
The user can compare the last 100 torque

grouped into 2 families: general and recent
data. The general data log collects data from
“test date” to “present date”. The test date is
set in house, can be viewed in the “name plate”
menu but cannot be changed. The recent data
log collects data from the last “clear recent
data log” date to “present date”.
Command “clear recent data log” is available
in the SET-UP MENU, maintenance, chapter 7.
This command clears the content of the recent
data log and resets the counters to 0. The old
data are lost.
The main differences between “general” and
“recent” data log are the following:
- The general data log gives information
relevant to the full life of the actuator, starting
from the manufacturing date.
- In the recent data log the same data
are collected starting from a date set by
the user. The date may be viewed in the
MAINTENANCE DATE paragraph.

Opening time This datum is only available in the general data log. It is updated at the end of every
full valve stroke of the valve in opening direction. The data of the previous stroke are
lost. It gives the time necessary to the valve to move from the close position to the open
position, expressed in hours, minutes and seconds.
Closing time This datum is only available in the general data log. It is updated at the end of every full
valve stroke of the valve in closing direction. The data of the previous stroke are lost.
It gives the time necessary to the valve to move from the open position to the close
position, expressed in hours, minutes and seconds.
Contactor cycles This number counts the cycles of contactors K1 and K2. The value indicated in the
general data log is also used to generate the “max. contactor cycles” warning when the
maximum allowable number of cycles of the contactor is reached (see paragraph 12.11,
Diagnostic messages). If the main power is DC or single phase and in modulating
actuators, the counters (general and recent) are hold to 0.
Motor run time This number counts the hours with motor energized.
No power time This number counts the hours without electrical power.
Utilization rate This number % is incremented every 200 full strokes of the actuator. It reaches 100%
after 20 000 full strokes.
Temperature min This is the lowest temperature value (in °C) measured inside the electronics
compartment.
Temperature max This is the highest temperature value (in °C) measured inside the electronics

Next date This is the date of the next scheduled actuator maintenance. When the date is reached, the
ICON 2000 generates a maintenance request warning. The date should be updated by the
user after all maintenance operations (see paragraph 9.3).
Start-up date This is the date of actuator start-up. During commissioning, the user should enter the
start-up date (see paragraph 9.3).
Recent log date This is updated after entering command “Clear recent data log” (see paragraph 9.3). This
command clears the “recent data log” counters. The content of “recent log” is updated
starting from “recent log date”.
10.4.6 Data logger
The “data logger” routine allows to collect
different types of data useful in maintenance
or in diagnostic programs. Since the amount of
collected data is very large, the data logger can
only be viewed by means of a PDA or PC. The
data can be up-loaded from ICON 2000 to PDA
or PC by the BluetoothTM wireless connection.
The local display only allows to view the
value of the configured parameters (see also
SET-UP menu, Maintenance, Set data logger,
paragraph 9.3.7). The following data can be
viewed on the local display:
- Logger mode
- Sampling time
- Memory mode
- Date
- Time
In RECORDER and T-RECORDER mode
the SAMPLING TIME fixes the time interval
among two sets of measures. Up to 256 sets
of measures (equivalent to 256x4 samples)
can be memorized. The sampling time can
be configured from 1 to 3600 secs. As the
memory is full, the recorder stops recording or
overwrites the previous data according to the
selected MEMORY MODE (“stop when full” or
“continuous”). If “continuous” was selected, as
a new set of measures is achieved the oldest
one is cancelled and the new one becomes
the latest. Up to 10000 cycles of full memory
overwriting are done, then the recorder stops.
In T-RECORDER mode, the recording operation
is also stopped in case of OVER-TORQUE
ALARM, in opening or in closing. This additional
feature allows to maintain in the memory the
last 256 samples and see the trend of torque,
motor temperature and main voltage before the
alarm. A new start of T-RECORDER clears the
data stored in the memory. By a PDA or PC the
recorded data can be viewed by a graph where
time is on the X axis and the measured data on
the Y axis.
Data logger modes:
• OFF: the data logger is not active.
• RECORDER mode: the ICON 2000 measures
and memorizes the following 3 data:
- Main voltage supply (V)
- Motor temperature (°C)
- Temperature inside the compartment of
electronics (°C)
• T-RECORDER mode: the ICON 2000
measures and memorizes the following
3 data:
- Torque in OP/CL
- Motor temperature (°C)
- Voltage

11 MAINTENANCE
11.1 STANDARD MAINTENANCE
Approx. every 2 years:
Under normal operating conditions, the
ICON 2000 is maintenance-free: no actuator
maintenance is formally required, even though
visual inspection for oil leakage or external
visible damages is recommended every two
years. When conditions are severe (frequent
operation or high temperatures), inspect the
oil level and oil quality more often. Replace all
seals that permit oil leakage or water ingress.
The following checks will assure optimum
performance:
• If the stem is external, check that the valve
stem is clean and lubricated. If not, clean it
and lubricate it in order to prevent damages
to the threaded bush.
• Lubricate the internal components of the
coupling block by means of the spherical
head lubricator using suggested greases
(see chapter 4, Lubrication).
• Make sure there are no oil leaks from
the actuator housing. The oil level should
be approx. 20 mm from the fill plug (see
chapter 4, Lubrication).
• Check the external parts for possible
damage and replace them immediately,
if necessary. In case the window glass is
broken, the complete cover must be replaced
(see chapter 13, Parts list and drawings for
individual item numbers).
• Repaint all areas where paint is missing.
In chemically aggressive or saline
environments, remove rust from surfaces and
protect with a rust preventative.
11.2 SPECIAL MAINTENANCE
In case actuator failure, please refer to
chapter 12, Troubleshooting for possible
causes.
Spare parts can be required to Biffi: please
refer to the individual item number shown in
chapter 13, Parts list and drawings.
IMPORTANT
Before starting any maintenance operation, make
sure that the mains and all other service voltage
connected to terminal board are switched-off.
WARNING
The actuator is non-intrusive. The control
compartment was sealed in dry and clean
conditions and contains no site serviceable
components. Do not open it unless absolutely
necessary. Unauthorized access will invalidate
the warranty.
WARNING
Since the control compartment contains a
3.6V lithium battery, only open it in safe area.
If the actuator is located in a hazardous area a
“hot work” permit must be obtained unless the
actuator can be moved to a non-hazardous area.
NOTE
Special maintenance is also recommended
when, during operations, the actuator
generates an excessive noise.
• Check that all nuts and bolts securing the
actuator to the valve are tight. If necessary,
re-tighten with a dynamometric key (for
tightening torque values see paragraph 3.4.3,
Installation - Mounting the actuator onto the
valve - Actuator fixing).
• For severe applications or if actuator
operation is infrequent, perform maintenance
checks more often.
• For actuators provided with lithium batteries,
make sure that the display is still visible when
power is off and that there is no “Battery
low” warning message. If “Battery low”
warning appears, replace the battery (see
paragraph 11.3 Maintenance - Lithium battery
change).
Always replace batteries if the actuator has
been subjected to long periods without power
(see chapter 12, Troubleshooting).
50
BIFFI ICON 2000
INSTRUCTION AND OPERATING MANUAL
• Disconnect two wires (+) (-) from the main
board.
• Bring the cover to a safe area. When in a safe
area:
- Remove the label.
WARNING
If the actuator is located in a hazardous area a
“hot work” permit must be obtained unless the
actuator can be moved to a non-hazardous area.
11.3 LITHIUM BATTERY CHANGE
• Isolate the main supply to the actuator and all
other control voltages.
• Open the terminal boards cover.
- Remove the battery cover.
- Replace the battery.

12 TROUBLESHOOTING
The ICON 2000 actuator has passed the
functional test performed by Biffi Quality
Assurance personnel.
WARNING
The actuator is non-intrusive. The control
compartment was sealed in dry and clean
conditions and contains no site serviceable
components. Do not open it unless absolutely
necessary. Unauthorized access will invalidate the
warranty.
WARNING
Since the control compartment contains a
3.6V lithium battery, only open it in safe area. If
the actuator is located in a hazardous area, a
“hot work” permit must be obtained unless the
actuator can be moved to a non-hazardous area.
If the actuator does not work, before
troubleshooting make sure that:
• the numeric display indicates xx %;
• the local selector is not in OFF;
• the main supply voltage is the same as stated
in the name plate menu;
• you move the local selector to OFF and check
that the alphanumeric display shows one of
the following messages:
- “normal off”
- “alarm off”
- “warning off”
- “ESD ON off”
- “INT off”
If the above checks are satisfactory try to locate
the fault using the diagnostic facilities.
12.1 THE ELECTRONICS DO NOT SWITCH ON
WHEN POWERED
• Check that the value of the main voltage on
terminals L1, L2, L3 is correct.
• Remove the cover of the compartment where
the electronic cards are located.
• Check the fuse mounted on the power card.
Replace it if burnt.
• If the fuse is OK, check the wires between
terminals L1, L2, L3 and connector M1 of
the power card. If it is correct, replace the
power card.
12.2 DC OUTPUT VOLTAGE NOT AVAILABLE
AT THE TERMINALS
• Switch the main power supply off and
disconnect all wires from terminals B1-B2
and C1.
• Switch the main power supply on and check if
the voltage on the terminals B1-B2 and C1 is
between 23 and 27 V DC.
• If the voltage is correct check the external
wiring and the electrical load. It should not
exceed 4 W.
• If the voltage is not correct replace the
power card.
1. Power card
2. Fuse
12.3 THE ACTUATOR DOES NOT WORK FROM
REMOTE CONTROLS
• Move the 3-position selector to LOCAL and
check that the actuator works from local
controls.
• Move the local selector to REMOTE. If the
ESD signal is active, the alphanumeric
display indicates “ESD On”. Check the signal
on terminals C3 and C4 and adjust the ESD
configuration. If the alphanumeric display
indicates “INT”, an interlock control is
present. Check the signal on terminals B3, B4
and B5, and adjust Interlocks configuration.
• Check that:
- the wiring to terminals B1-B2 and C1 is
correct;
- there is no short-circuit between wires;
- the electrical load does not exceed 4 W;
- the value is in the range 20-120 V AC
50/60 Hz or 20-125 V DC, if external voltage
supply is used.
12.4 THE MOTOR IS VERY HOT AND DOES
NOT START
• Check that no alarm other than motor
overheating is present.
• Wait until the motor cools down and the
normally closed contact of the thermal switch
automatically resets before trying to operate
the actuator again.
• Check that the number of operations per hour
and their duration is suitable for the actuator
service (see the name-plate menu).
• Check that the valve operating torque is
within the range of the unit’s designed
operating torque.
• Always check the causes of abnormal
operation.

BIFFI ICON 2000
INSTRUCTION AND OPERATING MANUAL
12.6 THE MANUAL OVERRIDE CANNOT
BE ENGAGED
In case the engagement of the lever is too
difficult, check whether the drive sleeve is stuck
and proceed as follows:
• Open the cover.
• Try to move the drive sleeve by a
screw-driver.
• Reassemble the cover.
12.7 THE VALVE DOES NOT SEAT CORRECTLY
• If the valve is stopped by the torque limit in
closing, increase the actuator output torque
limit.
• If the valve is stopped by the position limit
in closing, check that the valve reaches its
seat position, then readjust the setting of the
position limit.
• The internal trim of the valve may be
damaged.
12.8 EXCESSIVE TORQUE FOR VALVE
OPERATION
• Clean, lubricate and check the valve stem.
• Valve packing too tight: loosen the gland
bolt nuts.
• Coupling type “A”: tight fit between bush and
stem: increase the thread clearance on the
drive coupling.
• Coupling types “B1”, “B2”, “B3” and “B4”:
ensure there are no axial forces on the valve
stem by leaving an adequate axial clearance
between the stem and the drive bush. Also
check that all transmission shafts, universal
joints or bulkhead passages have sufficient
lubrication and check that the transmission
shafts are not bent.
• Check that the internal valve trim or the
reducer gears are well lubricated and not
damaged.
• Check the alphanumeric display for
diagnostic messages, and proceed with the
suitable corrective actions as described in
this chapter, paragraph 12.11, Diagnostic
messages.
12.9 THE ACTUATOR DOES NOT STOP IN
FULLY OPEN OR FULLY CLOSED POSITION
• Check that the actual open and close
positions of the valve respectively correspond
to 100% and 0% on the actuator display
• Make sure that the torque and travel limits
are correctly set (see paragraph 9.1, Set-up
routines - Actuator set-up).
12.10 THE NUMERIC POSITION DISPLAY
INDICATES “E01”
• It is necessary to re-calibrate the stroke
limits (see paragraph 9.1, Set-up routines -
Actuator set-up).
12.5 THE MOTOR RUNS BUT THE ACTUATOR
DOES NOT MOVE THE VALVE
In case the local display does not change the valve
position indicators:
• Check that the manual de-clutch lever is not
stuck in manual operation position.
• Rotate the handwheel a few degrees to
remove all possible sticking between the
handwheel and the drive sleeve.
In case the local display changes the valve
position indicators:
• Verify the stem nut correctly fits in the
actuator base.
• Verify the stem nut has sufficient engagement
with the valve stem.
• Verify the key correctly fits in bore/keyways
applications.
• Check that the valve works in manual
operation. If not, it is necessary to check the
manual control area as follows:
- Loosen the handwheel security dowel.
- Remove the handwheel.
- Remove the cover supporting the
handwheel.
- Check the integrity of the internal parts.
- Proceeding with the assembly, follow the
reverse order of the disassembly.

21.3 REPAIRS
When needed, repair must only be carried out
with manufacturer’s original spare parts.
WARNING
The values of gaps of explosion-proof joints are
lower than the maximum specified on tables
of IEC/EN 60079-1 Standard and the values of
widths of the explosion-proof joints are superior
to the values specified on tables of the Standard
IEC/EN 60079-1. In case the maintenance should
require the replacement of any component which
forms part of an explosion-proof joint, only an
original spare provided by Biffi MUST be used.
Direct repair or reconstruction of the above
components are not permitted without the Biffi
permission. Not performing this procedure will
invalidate the product safety and contractual
guarantee.
Original spare parts must be required to the
manufacturer: to ensure that right spare
is provided, serial number printed on the
ICON 2000 unit enclosure label must be
specified when spares are ordered.
21.2 DISMANTLING AND REASSEMBLING
WARNING
In case the screws of the cover must been
replaced, a SS AISI 316 Class A4 Grade 70,
must be used with minimum yield strength of
450 N/mm2
.
In case a dismantling and subsequent
reassembling of the explosion-proof enclosure
is required, be careful to maintain all parts in
their original condition.
So the following procedure must be followed:
• Do not damage the explosion-proof mating
surfaces on the housing and on the electrical
enclosure cover.
21 MAINTENANCE
WARNING
In case the units equipped with extension
for additional entry or additional entries,
already installed in HAZARDOUS AREAS, need
maintenance and/or any repair work, this must be
carried out by personnel specifically qualified and
fully trained for works in HAZARDOUS AREAS.
21.1 PERIODIC INSPECTIONS
• Inspect the general conditions of the
ICON 2000 / ICON 2000 AD plus the possible
optional additional extension at regular
intervals: recommended frequency of
inspection is one time every two years but this
frequency could be changed depending on the
installation and working conditions: any crack
on the surface, broken window or loose bolts
must be reported for repair.
• Keep the external surfaces of the unit clean:
if the unit is installed in a dusty environment
the specification stated in IEC/EN 60079-14
to be followed ensuring in particular that the
dust layer does not exceed 5 mm.
• Check the condition of cable connection and
mounting bolts: any loose connection must be
amended.
• Reinstall all the screws that go with the
dismantled parts and block after spreading
them with a film of molybdenum-based
grease. This will keep screws from sticking
and make maintenance future operations
easier.
• In case the screws need to be changed it is
mandatory to assure that the new screws are
of the same dimension and same material as
the original ones as stated in this manual, or
of a better quality.
• Replace the weatherproof seals that may
have been removed i.e: O-rings for the cover.
• In particular, be sure the joint surfaces of
all enclosures are spread with a film of

• Keep the external surfaces of the unit clean:
if the unit is installed in a dusty environment
the specification stated in IEC/EN 60079-14
to be followed ensuring in particular that the
dust layer does not exceed 5 mm.
• Check the condition of cable connection and
mounting bolts: any loose connection must
be amended.
• Reinstall all the screws that go with the
dismantled parts and block after spreading
them with a film of molybdenum-based
grease. This will keep screws from sticking
and make maintenance future operations
easier.
• In case the screws need to be changed it is
mandatory to assure that the new screws are
of the same dimension and same material as
the original ones as stated in this manual, or
of a better quality.
• Replace the weatherproof seals that may
have been removed i.e: O-rings for the cover.
