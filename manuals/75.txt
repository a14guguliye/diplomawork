IOM TopWorx engineers are happy to provide technical assistance on GO™ Switch products. However, it is the customer’s responsibility to determine the safety and suitability of the product in their application.
It is also the customer’s responsibility to install the switch using the current electrical codes in their region. 70 Series
Setting Up A 70 Series GO™
Switch For Optimum Performance
GO™ Switch 70 Series end sensing switches
use three permanent magnets and a pushpull plunger to control a set of mechanical
contacts. The center magnet simultaneously
attracts the primary magnet and repels the
bias magnet, pushing the connecting rod
and common contact into the normally closed
position, closing a contact circuit. When a
ferrous or magnetic target enters the sensing
area of the switch, it attracts the primary
magnet, which pulls the connecting rod and
common contact. The normally closed and
normally open contacts change state.
The sensing distance is the maximum
distance between the switch and target when
the switch first operates; the trip point. The
differential, also known as deadband or
hysteresis, is the distance that the target must
move from the sensing area in order to allow
the switch to reset.
To apply the 70 Series GO™ Switch and
obtain the least differential, the direction
the target approaches the switch must
be considered. Below are two possible
orientations that illustrate the differences in
target movement and the affects on switch
differential.
The measurements shown are nominal and
can vary as much as .030-.050” depending
on the material and size of target used in the
application. As you can see, the best scenario
for least differential is to orient the switch and
target as shown in Orientation B. However,
in this application, the possibility of getting
debris be-tween the switch and target must
also be considered.
When trying to determine differential of
an application, it is directly proportional
to the distance the target will travel in the
application. For example: a linear valve stroke
is 1”. A switch is applied to indicate the closed
position of the valve. Using Orientation A,
the differential is 0.090 “. The ‘deadband’ is
therefore 9% of travel. If the switch were reoriented, as shown in the Orientation B, the
deadband would be only 2% of the total valve
travel.
Remember, there is no exact science to use
when applying a GO™ Switch. However,
once the switch is set, and the target travels
to the same position every time (within .002”),
the GO™ Switch will maintain calibration for
life. Set it and forget it!
Attachment of Conduit/Field Wiring
– When using long runs of conduit, place
supports close to the switch to avoid
pulling switch out of position.
– If switch is mounted on a moving part,
be sure flexible conduit is long enough
to allow for movement, and positioned to
eliminate binding or pulling.
– All conduit connected electrical devices,
including GO™ Switches, are advised
to be sealed against water ingression
through the conduit system. See Figures
1 and 2 for best practices.
– Over sheathed or individual conductors
must be mechanically protected against
damage and appropriately terminated
within a terminal or junction facility.
– An external ground connection must
be protected via external mounting
device, cable connection or conduit.
For hazardous locations/explosive
atmospheres install per local Electrical
Code. Dry contact devices, such as GO™
Switch, maybe installed intrinsically safe with
matched barrier. 70 Series is hermetically
sealed and does not require the installation
of a separate conduit seal in the conduit
connected system (e.g. UL/CSA CL I/II Div1)
For Hermetic seal per UL Standard, use
7G-Series
All GO™ Switches are “pure” contact
switches, meaning they have no voltage
drop when closed, nor do they have any
leakage current when open. For multi-unit
installation, switches may be wired in
series or parallel, as shown below.
Series Wiring
Any number of GO™ Switches may be wired
in series, without voltage drop. By contrast,
solid state switches have about two volts drop
across the switch when operated. In a 12
volt solid state system with four switches in
series, 8 volts is dropped across the switches.
Only 4V is left to operate the load. When
using GO™ Switches, 12V is still available
to operate the load. (Except 7L - approx. 5V
drop)
Parallel Wiring
When solid state switches are placed in
parallel, there is about 100 micro amps
leakage through each switch. If ten solid
state switches were wired in parallel, the
total leakage current would be 1000 microamps or one milliamp - sufficient current to
indicate an “ON” condition to a programmable
logic controller (PLC). Any number of GO™
Switches may be wired in parallel, with
no current leakage and without drawing
operating current. (Except 7L - approx. 5V
drop)
Introduction
GO™ Switches operate on the principle of
magnetic attraction, reacting to ferrous metal
or magnetic targets as they come within the
switch’s sensing range.
Although switches vary in design according to
their intended applications, all GO™ Switches
use permanent magnets which, when actuated
by the presence of a ferrous or magnetic
target, change the state of electrical contacts.
Mounting
- 70 Series GO™ Switches are unaffected by
weld fields and RF interference.
- 70 Series GO™ Switches may be mounted
adjacent to or surrounded by ferrous metals
however the proximity of ferrous metals will
affect sensing distance. For the maximum
rated sensing distance, avoid mounting near
ferrous metals.
- GO™ Switches sense ferrous materials such
as mild steel, 400 series and 17/4 stainless
steel.
- Sensing and differential of switch may vary
depending on target travel direction.
- Avoid contact between target and switch.
Configure mounting of switch and/or target
so that target passes within the sensing area.
Sensing range will vary according to model
number and mass of target used.
-Target magnets, available through TopWorx,
will increase the sensing range of the switch.
Reference sensing ranges in corresponding
sections throughout the catalog.
-For optimum performance, provide sufficient
mass of target, and choose the appropriate
GO™ Switch model to match the application
requirements for operating frequency, type of
load, etc.
- Greater target mass and target movement
fully into and out of sensing range will increase
contact pressure. This is helpful in low current
controls applications.
- For heavy or inductive loads, arc
suppression devices, or interposing relays are
recommended for contact longevity. Contact
factory for specifics.
- Do not use excessive force on external
threads when installing. For typical
installations: Torque 3/8” threads to 60lbs-in
(7 Nm) max. Torque 5/8” threads to 35 lbs.-ft.
(47 N-m) max. Consult TopWorx technician for
special installations.
- Configure mounting so bracket dissects
switch as close to the middle of the body as
possible. This eliminates undue stress caused
by heavy cables, connectors, etc.
- Two appropriately sized jam nuts are included
with switch. Lock washers are recommended
where vibration is present.

Special Conditions for Safe Use and Possible Misuse
-The over sheathed or individual conductors must be suitably protected against
mechanical damage and terminated within a terminal or junction facility suitable for
the conditions of use.
-Three wire/three pin devices are not provided with an external connection facility for
the earthing or bonding conductor. It is the user's responsibility to ensure adequate
earth continuity via the mounting arrangements.
-Both contacts of the Double Throw and the separate poles of the Double Pole switch,
within one proximity switch must form part of the same intrinsically safe circuit.
-The proximity switches do not require a connection to earth for safety purposes,
but an earth connection is provided which is directly connected to the metallic
enclosure. Normally an intrinsically safe circuit may be earthed at one point only. If
the earth connection is used, the implications of this must be fully considered in any
installation. i.e. by the use of a galvanically isolated interface.
- The switch must be
supplied from a Certified
Ex ia IIC intrinsically safe
source
- The flying leads must
be terminated in a manner
suitable for the zone of
installation.
- An external ground
connection must be
protected by an external
mounting device and / or
cable connections /conduits.
- For 74 Series switch,
operating and certified
ambient temperatures are
marked T6 / T85 °C (-20 °C
≤ Ta ≤ +50 °C).
DMD 4 Pin M12 Connector
External ground must be
used with 120VAC and
voltages greater then
60VDC when using the
DMD connector
The GO Switch can be
wired as PNP or NPN
depending on the desired
application
