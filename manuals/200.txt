1 GENERAL VALVE DESCRIPTION AND START-UP
1.1 General
The Anderson Greenwood Series 200 Pilot
Operated SRV uses the principle of pressurizing
the larger top area of a differential area piston
with line pressure to hold the piston closed up
to set pressure. At set pressure the pilot valve
relieves, depressurizing the volume on top of
the piston causing the piston to lift and the
main valve to relieve. When the pilot reseats,
the volume on top of the piston is repressurized
and the main valve closes.
Set pressure range 25 psig to 10.600 psig.
1.2 Installation
Both inlet and outlet may be standard ANSI
flanges or threaded connections and are to be
installed in accordance with accepted piping
practices.
1.3 Start-up
There must be pressure at the valve inlet to
establish a differential in force across the
piston and ‘load’ it in the closed position.
Pressure must pass through the pilot supply
tube and pilot and exert force on top of the
piston. On normal plant start-up, the valve
loads itself as pressure increases. It is not
uncommon that slight leakage past the main
seat occurs until system pressure reaches two
or three pounds. This amount of pressure is
sometimes needed for the soft seat to form a
seal with the nozzle.
Block valves are often used under safety valves
in order to isolate them when maintenance
is required. When putting the safety valve in
service be sure the block valve is fully opened.
If the block valve is opened after system start-up,
the safety valve may briefly relieve before the
volume on top of the piston is pressurized.
1.4 Maintenance
Anderson Greenwood recommended main valve
and pilot maintenance procedures including
pilot set pressure adjustment and valve
assembly testing are described in the following
paragraphs. Following these procedures in
a regular pressure relief valve maintenance
program appropriate for the specific operating
conditions will ensure satisfactory valve
performance and provide optimum service life.
Should the pressure/media requirements of a
pilot operated pressure relief valve be outside
the capabilities of the repair facility, contact
Anderson Greenwood for specific instructions
before starting any maintenance activity.
This manual is provided as a general guide
for the maintenance of the safety valves
described herein. It does not include
procedures covering all valve configurations
and variations manufactured by Anderson
Greenwood. The user is advised to contact
Anderson Greenwood or one of our authorized
representatives for assistance with valve
configurations and variations not covered in this
manual.

When remote pressure pick-up is used the pilot
supply tube is connected to a remote location
rather than the inlet neck of the valve. If a block
valve is used in the remote pilot supply line, it
must be opened before pressurizing the system
or opening the isolating block valve under
the main valve.
NOTE
Remote pressure pick-up piping must have the
equivalent flow area of ⅜” tubing for lengths up to
100 feet. For lengths greater than this, consult the factory
For valves supplied with eyebolts, follow
the instructions in Anderson Greenwood

2 MAIN VALVE MAINTENANCE
2.1 Disassembly
Before beginning disassembly, bleed off any
pressure trapped in the main valve or pilot.
Refer to Figure 1A (piston/seat Type XX3) and
Figure 1B (piston/seat Type XX9) for parts
description and location.
Remove cap (Item 17) from the body (Item 1).
Remove the liner seal (Item 6), liner (Item 5)
and piston (Item 10). Remove the soft goods
from the piston. If the piston is equipped with
a wedge ring (Item 15), clean and retain for
use during assembly. The dipper tube (Item 4)
is swaged in place and no attempt should be
made to remove it. The nozzle (Item 3) should
not be removed unless it is damaged or the
nozzle seal (Item 2) is leaking.
NOTE
Do not remove lock pin and lift adjusting bolt (Items 11
and 12) on valves so equipped unless nozzle is
removed. This bolt controls the piston lift and hence
the valve’s relieving capacity. If either or both the
nozzle and lift bolt were removed, then lift must be
reset following the procedure of paragraph 2.3.3
(Type XX3) or paragraph 2.3.4 (Type XX9).
2.1.1 Nozzle and nozzle seal disassembly
Refer to Figure 2 for parts description and
location.
1. Remove lock pin and lift adjusting bolt from
piston, if applicable.
2. Place liner in body and piston, without seat
or seat retainer, into liner and on top of
nozzle.
3. Place appropriate spacer (see Table II)
on top of piston and then the cap over the
spacer.
4. Thread the appropriate number of cap bolts
(see Table II) into threaded holes on top
of body. If two bolts are used, they should
be 180° apart. When using four bolts, they
should be 90° apart. Always use the shortest
cap bolts supplied with the valve unless
Minimum
projection
all cap bolts are required. For example,
the 1” Type 40/50 is equipped with two 1.50”
long bolts and two 1.88” long bolts but only
the two 1.50” long bolts should be used.
However, the 2” Type 40/50 is equipped with
two 1.25” long bolts and two 1.62” long bolts
and all four bolts are required for nozzle
installation.
5. Tighten cap bolts evenly to the torque listed
in Table II to compress nozzle seal.
6. Use a punch or bar with a light hammer
and tap on the nozzle retainer teeth to
loosen the nozzle retainer. Unthread nozzle
retainer approximately ½ turn.
7. Loosen cap bolts to remove load from nozzle.
Remove components from main valve.

INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE INSTRUCTIONS
2.3 Assembly
2.3.1 Nozzle and nozzle seal installation
1. Place nozzle seal and nozzle in body.
2. Place nozzle retainer over nozzle and thread
into body until it stops on nozzle shoulder.
Do not lubricate nozzle retainer threads or
mating body threads.
3. Repeat steps 3 through 5 of disassembly
procedure to compress nozzle seal.
Thread nozzle retainer into body as seal is
compressed to keep nozzle retainer from
binding against piston.
4. Use a punch or bar with a light hammer and
tap on the nozzle retainer teeth to snug the
nozzle retainer threads.
5. Loosen cap bolts to remove load from
spacer.
6. Remove spacer from valve.
2.3.2 Soft goods installation and main valve
reassembly
Refer to Figure 1A (piston/seat Type XX3) and
Figure 1B (piston/seat Type XX9) for parts
description and location.
2.3.4 Type XX9 piston and seat
Install new piston seal and snap ring along with
original wedge ring (if so equipped). Install new
seat and reassemble seat retainer and seat
retainer screw. Do not apply any lubricant to
any of the soft goods.
NOTE
Over tightening of seat retainer screw or bolts can
distort or damage seat and cause leakage. Retainer
screw or bolts should be installed until assembly is
snug. Then tighten an additional ¼ to ½ turn to secure
assembly.
On 1” to 4” Type 49/59 and 1.5” to 3” Type 69
valves, if the nozzle or lift bolt were removed,
then lift needs to be set. If lift setting gages are
available, use lift setting procedure 06.2284,
otherwise use procedure 05.2284.
On 1” to 4” Type 40 -RL (Special Restricted Lift.
This is different than Type 50 restricted lift)
valves, use lift setting procedure # 1101-28214.
Install new liner seal and apply a light coat of
lubricant to cap bolt threads. When installing
the cap, make sure it is seated squarely into
body. Torque cap bolts uniformly so as not to
‘cock’ cap. See Table III for torque values. Such
a condition may result in leakage at the liner
seal or cause the piston and liner to bind.
2.3.3 Type XX3 piston and seat
Replace piston and liner seals. Install piston
seals in groove locations shown in Table I.
Install new seat and reassemble seat retainer
and seat retainer screw or bolts.
NOTE
Over tightening of seat retainer screw or bolts can
distort or damage seat and cause leakage. Retainer
screw or bolts should be installed until assembly is
snug. Then tighten an additional ¼ to ½ turn to secure
assembly.
Apply a light coat of lubricant on all threads
after cleaning. Lubricate upper portion of liner
I.D., piston seal and wedge ring or back up ring
with Dow Corning No. 33 or equivalent below
275 psig set pressure. At 275 psig and above
use Desco 600, or equivalent. Use lubricant
sparingly.
On 1” to 4” Type 43/53 and 1.5” to 3” Type 63
valves, if the nozzle or lift bolt were removed,
then lift needs to be set. If lift setting gages are
available, use lift setting procedure 06.3349,
otherwise use procedure 05.2284.
2.2 Main valve nozzle rework
Should the main valve nozzle seating face
become nicked or scratched such that the main
valve seat does not seal, the imperfections
can be removed by polishing the nozzle face
with 400 grit sandpaper on a flat surface plate.
Certain critical nozzle dimensions and finishes
must be maintained and those are shown in the
figure and table below.
On 1” to 4” Type 40 -RL (Special Restricted Lift.
This is different than Type 50 restricted lift)
valves, use lift setting procedure # 1101-28214.
When installing the cap, make sure it is seated
squarely into body. Torque capbolts uniformly
so as not to ‘cock’ cap. See Table III for torque
values. Such a condition may result in leakage
at the liner seal or cause the piston and liner
to bind.

3 PILOT MAINTENANCE
3.1 Disassembly
3.1.1 To facilitate assembly, place all parts
in an orderly arrangement as they are
removed so the correct parts can be
assembled in the proper sequence.
Refer to Figure 3 for parts description
and location.
Remove spring compression by backing
out adjusting screw. Remove bonnet,
being careful to catch spring and spring
washers when they disengage. Turn pilot
upside down to remove internals parts
from upper half of body.
Loosen bushing, Item 20, at bottom of
pilot and remove blowdown adjustment
screw. Remove seat, Item 18, from
blowdown adjustment screw and O-ring
seated shuttle located inside.
3.1.2 For pilots equipped with a field test
assembly (Figure 5) remove the
assembly from the pilot body (Figure 5).
Unscrew the bushing from the assembly
and remove the spring and shuttle.
3.2 Assembly
Assemble valve in reverse order of
disassembly. Lubricate all screw threads and
bearing ends of spring washers. Use Dow
Corning No. 33 Silicone grease, or equivalent.
A small amount of lubricant should also
be applied to the bonnet seal (Item 8) the
blowdown screw seal (Item 24), the bushing
seal (Item 19) and the blowdown seal (Item 21).
Torque blowdown seal jam nut to 50-55 ft·lbs.
The shaft seal (Item 28), nut seal (Item 26) and
cam bearing points should also be lubricated
on the lift lever pilot.
NOTE
1. Do not lubricate or get any lubricant on the spindle
or seat. Lubricant on these surfaces will collect
dirt during normal relieving cycles and cause
erratic pilot action.
2. If Items 14, 20 and 32 are removed, make sure
all the shims, Item 31, have been replaced. Be
sure that the smooth unmarked face of jam nut,
Item 32, is against the adjacent blowdown bushing
face when assembling. If any internal metal
parts are replaced, check and adjust the lift of
the spindle, Item 6. Refer to Figure 6 for the lift
adjustment procedure.
3. On field test assemblies and backflow preventers,
lubricate bushing seal(s) only. Do not get any
lubricant on the shuttle, shuttle seat(s) and or
bushing seat

4 PILOT SET PRESSURE ADJUSTMENT
4.1 General
Two adjustments are provided; one for varying
the pressure at which the pilot opens and one for
varying the pressure at which the pilot closes.
4.2 Set pressure
To adjust set pressure, a test set-up similar to
that shown in Figure 4 should be used. The set
pressure adjustment screw should be turned IN
most of the way and the blowdown adjustment
screw should be turned out most of the way.
Increase the supply pressure to the nameplate
setting and slowly back the adjustment screw
out until the pilot ‘pops’ at the desired set
pressure. Lock the adjusting screw with the
jam nut and cycle the pilot several times to
make sure the setting is correct.
NOTE
When the pilot ‘pops’, the dome pressure decreases to
zero and no flow of gas should be detected at the pilot
vent after pop. If gas continues to flow through the vent,
the blowdown screw is turned in too far.
4.3 Reseat pressure (blowdown)
To adjust reseat, decrease the pressure in the
accumulator to the desired reseat pressure and
turn the blowdown adjustment screw in until
the pilot actuates. When this happens, the dome
pressure will immediately increase to the supply
pressure level. If the pilot reseats above the
desired pressure, turn the blowdown adjustment
screw out. Lock the blowdown adjusting screw
with the jam nut with the recommended torque
of 50-55 ft·lbs and cycle the pilot several times to
make sure the setting is correct.
4.4 Range of adjustment
All pilots can be adjusted ± 5% beyond the
nameplate setting.
4.5 Adjustment tolerances
Cracking pressure: 95% or more of specified
set pressure
Set pressure: ± 3% of specified set
pressure above 70 psig
set ± 2 psig for 70 psig and
below
Reseat pressure: 90-92% of specified set
pressure for internal
pressure sense 94-96% of
specified set pressure for
remote pressure sense
Dome pressure should be zero
when pilot is actuated and no gas
flow is detected at pilot vent.

5 LEAK TESTING ASSEMBLY
5.1 General
The complete valve assembly should be leak
tested for internal and external leaks using a
pressure equal to 30% and 90% of set.
5.2 Internal leak test
Nozzle: use a piece of wide masking tape to
cover the lower part of the main valve outlet,
taped across the opening 2” to 3” high. Pour
in enough water to cover just the base of the
nozzle. If bubbles are detected, the nozzle seal
is leaking. Replacement of the seal involves
removal of the nozzle. See paragraph 2.1.1 for
the nozzle removal procedure.
Main seat: pour in enough water to just
cover the bottom of the piston. If bubbles are
detected, the main seat is leaking. The nozzle
or seat may be damaged or the piston may not
be seating squarely on the nozzle. For improper
piston seating on low pressure valves (less than
275 psig set), pressurize dome of main valve to
275 psig to align seat. Improper piston seating
may also be due to incorrect assembly of cap to
body. Refer to Section 2.
Piston seal: if no bubbles are detected at main
seat, increase the water level to cover the lower
part of the liner. More masking tape may be
used. If bubbles are detected, the piston seal at
the top part of the piston is leaking; the piston
seal may be defective due to excessive molding
flash or the liner may be scratched.

ANDERSON GREENWOOD SERIES 200 POSRV
INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE INSTRUCTIONS
5.3 External leak test
Following the internal leak test, check for
external leakage by applying leak test solution
to all joints and seals. Tighten bolts or fittings
as required. If a leak is observed between
the cap and body, be sure the cap has been
assembled squarely against the liner before
tightening cap bolts.
6 PILOT SET PRESSURE FIELD TEST
PROCEDURE
CAUTION
It is not necessary to remove the pressure relief
valve from service to check the set pressure;
however, if the pressure relief valve is not isolated
from the process media while performing this
test, the main valve will open if there is process
pressure at the valve inlet.
6.1 General
The set pressure of valves equipped with a field
test accessory can be checked with the valve
installed, in operation. The field test accessory
consists of a check valve in the pilot supply line
through which test pressure from an external
source can be supplied to the pilot. A test set-up
similar to that shown in Figure 2 and procedure
similar to the following should be used.
6.2 Procedure
a. Remove dust plug from field test port and
connect flexible hose from test gas bottle.
b. Close vent valve ‘C’.
c. Open block valve ‘A’ slowly to increase
pressure until pilot ‘pops’ (with process
pressure at inlet, main valve opens). The set
pressure will be the pressure indicated on
the test gauge at the time the pilot ‘pops’.
Flexible hose

FIGURE 5
d. Close valve ‘A’ and slowly open valve ‘C’ to
reduce the pressure until the pilot actuates
as shown by a sudden drop of pressure
indicated on the test gauge (with process
pressure at inlet, main valve closes). The
indicated pressure at the time the pilot
actuates is pilot reseat pressure and will be
approximately 4% lower than actual reseat
pressure if the pilot is equipped for internal
pressure pick-up. If remote pressure pickup is used, the pressure indicated will be
the actual reseat pressure.
e. To remove test set-up, close block valve ‘A’,
open vent valve ‘C’, remove flexible hose
from field test port, and replace dust plug.
