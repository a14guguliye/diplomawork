ANDERSON GREENWOOD 4142HF PRESSURE RELIEF VALVE
INSTALLATION, OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE INSTRUCTIONS
1 SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
Read and understand this instruction manual
before installing, operating or performing
maintenance on the Anderson Greenwood
4142HF Pressure Relief Valve (PRV) following
all precautions and warnings noted herein.
NOTE
This manual is issued for guidance only and does
not affect our standard terms and conditions and
our Product Limited Warranty, all of which are
available on request.
WARNING
The relief valve must be isolated from tank
pressure before servicing. All gas/vapour must
be blocked and pressure safely vented. Wear
appropriate protective clothing and breathing
apparatus if hazardous gas/vapours are present.
Use appropriate lifting equipment where required.
3 OPERATION
The Anderson Greenwood 4142HF PRV is a
direct acting vent valve based on the weight of
the pallet to keep the valve closed. When tank
pressure acting on the seat sealing area equals
the opposing force acting on the pallet, the
valve is on the threshold of opening. Any further
increase in pressure will cause the pressure
pallet to lift allowing the contents of the tank to
vent through the valve (out-breathing).
In order for the valve to open and achieve its
design lift, an overpressure will be required.
The 4142HF PRV has been designed to achieve
this design lift and rated capacity within 10%
overpressure. Since the weight on the pallet
determines the set pressure of the valve, the
settings are changed by varying the weight on
the pallet.
2 GENERAL DESCRIPTION
The Anderson Greenwood 4142HF PRV is
employed in gas/vapour service applications
for low pressure storage tanks, vessels or
applications requiring low pressure protection
with high capacity flow requirements. This
product helps to prevent damage to the tank
and also prevents the tank’s contents from
escaping, ensuring the safety of personnel and
the surrounding environment.
Pressure relief valves are designed to limit the
maximum pressure that can exist in a tank due
to inflow of the tank contents or due to changes
in temperature as a result of environmental
conditions.
• For ease of maintenance, both pressure and
vacuum seats are removable.
• Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) coated
internals are supplied as an all-weather
option.

ANDERSON GREENWOOD 4142HF PRESSURE RELIEF VALVE
INSTALLATION, OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE INSTRUCTIONS
4 SET PRESSURE VERIFICATION
If the pressure setting is to be verified prior to
installation, it is recommended that a test rig
with a suitable accumulator be used having the
following general features:
• Connection to the accumulator tank should
ensure a negligible pressure drop between
the accumulator and the test valve.
• Observed pressure shall be measured in the
accumulator tank.
• The flange on which the valve is mounted
shall be level.
• The valve should be tested using clean air or
nitrogen.
Remove valve from shipping container and
remove all packaging. Check that the pressure
setting, the rated capacity and other details on
the nameplate are correct.
4.1 Set Pressure Verification
For set pressure verification, the test apparatus
needs to limit the maximum flow rate into
the accumulator such that a pressure drop
measured in the accumulator can be observed
when the valve set pressure is reached.
1. Ensure that the test rig is clean and fasten
the valve securely to the test flange.
2. Check nameplate for required set pressure.
3. Increase the inlet pressure slowly until the
pallet assembly can be seen to be gently
lifting and reseating on the seat. The inlet
pressure at this point is the adjusted set
pressure and should coincide with the point
at which no further rise in inlet pressure
is observed. Repeat a further two times to
ensure repeatability.
4.2 Set Pressure Adjustment (See Figure 1)
The valve has been factory set to the required
setting, however, if it is necessary to make a
set pressure adjustment this can be done as
follows:
1. Remove hex set screws [7] and washers [5]
then remove cover [2] and O-ring [8].
2. The set pressure can be increased or
reduced by adding or removing lead weights
which can be supplied in various settings.
3. Refit cover [2] ensuring O-ring [8] is correctly
installed and secure using hex set screw [7]
and washers [5].
CAUTION
Whenever the cover is removed and re fitted,
ensure correct engagement of the pallet stem in
the weather hood guide tube.
4. Repeat set pressure verification as per 4.1
and repeat set pressure adjustment if
required.
If it is not possible to verify the set pressure on
a test rig, the required setting can be verified
by measuring the combined weight of the pallet
and installed weights. Refer to Table 4 for
combined weight and equivalent set pressures.
5 INSTALLATION
The mating connection to the tank should be
flat machined horizontal flange and should be
thoroughly cleaned to remove all foreign matter
which could lead to valve leakage if trapped
between the valve seat and the pallet. The bore
diameter of the tank connection nozzle should
be at least equal to the inlet bore of the valve
connection. For correct valve operation, all
discharge piping shall be adequately supported
and there shall be no external loads applied to
the valve body.
Fit an inlet gasket to the mating flange
ensuring it does not obstruct the flow path
and install the valve. Ensure that the main axis
of the valve is perpendicular. Flange bolting
should be tightened uniformly to ensure a good
seal.
For valves of aluminium construction,
appropriate flat face flanges should be used
and a full face gasket fitted.
NOTE:
Storage tank inlet piping configurations should
conform to recognised standards. Different
configurations will develop different inlet pressure
losses when the valve is flowing. This should be
taken into consideration when sizing the valve for
the application.
It is recommended that the external surfaces
of carbon steel valves are painted immediately
after installation.
Any discharge pipework should be adequately
supported to prevent any loads being applied
to the valve body and should have adequate
drainage to prevent accumulation of liquids on
the downstream side.
Discharge pipework must be at least equal in
size to the valve outlet and any built up back
pressure in the discharge line should be limited
to 10% of the valve set pressure.
Discharge lines should be positioned so as
to allow safe disposal of tank contents under
relief conditions.

INSTALLATION, OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE INSTRUCTIONS
6 MAINTENANCE
Regular inspection should be carried out to
ensure that the pressure port is free from
debris and that nothing preventing the correct
operation of the valve is present. Maintenance
should be performed at regular intervals and
should be carried out by suitably qualified
personnel in an appropriately equipped
workshop. Alternatively, the valve should
be returned to the manufacturer or suitably
authorized agent for service/repair. During
transport to the workshop the valve should
be kept vertical to prevent damage to the
internals.
WARNING
The relief valve must be isolated from tank
pressure before servicing or removing. All gas/
vapour must be blocked and pressure safely
vented. Wear appropriate protective clothing and
breathing apparatus if hazardous gas/vapours
are present.
6.1 Valve Disassembly (For reference
numbers, see Figure 1)

6.3 Valve Refurbishment
With valve in component parts thoroughly clean
all surfaces with a suitable solvent and check
for wear, corrosion or other forms of damage.
Particular attention should be given to the
sealing face of the valve seat.
Sealing Face
Slight damage can be removed by lapping the
seat face (removing guide posts); however, care
should be taken not to increase the width of
the seat face beyond those given in table 1. If
successive refurbishments or severe damage
requires the seat to be re-machined, consult
the factory for approved dimensions.
Discard and replace any damaged parts plus all
soft goods including:
• O-rings
• Diaphragms
• Backing Disks
• Spacer Disks
• Gasket
Also discard and replace the pallet disc.
See table 5 for replacement parts.

7 TESTING SET PRESSURE
The pressure setting should be checked and if
necessary adjusted as described in section 4.
8 PALLET IDENTIFICATION
The pressure setting should be checked and if
necessary adjusted as described in section 4.
1. Pressure Ranges
There are three pallet designs with the
following designations which each cover the
respective pressure ranges given in table 3.
• VLP This is a plain spun pallet suitable for
very low pressures.
• LP This is simillar to the VLP pallet appart
from the material thickness and is
suitable for slightly higher pressure.
See table 3 for comparison of material
thicknes.
• HP This construction uses a substantial
disc in combination with a spun pallet
and is suitable for use up to the highest
pressures.
