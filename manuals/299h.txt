Description
The 299H Series Pressure Reducing Regulators
provide a broad capacity of controlled pressure
ranges and capacities in a wide variety of distribution,
industrial and commercial applications. A 299H Series
Regulator has a pilot integrally mounted to the actuator
casing. The 299H Series Regulators can handle inlet
pressures up to 175 psi / 12.1 bar depending on
orifice size.
The integral token relief on the Types 299HR and
299HVR Regulators is located in the pilot and opens to
relieve minor overpressure.
The Type 299HV provide overpressure or
overpressure and underpressure protection by
completely shutting off the flow of gas to the
downstream system.

3299H Series
Table 1. Body Sizes and End Connection Styles
It comes with a Type VSX8 (299HV) slam-shut device
which can be configured for Ovepressure Shutoff
(OPSO) or Overpressure and Underpressure Shutoff
(OPSO/UPSO). The slam-shut device’s actions are
independent of the main valve and of variations to the
inlet pressure.
The Type VSX8 (299HV) slam-shut device has internal
or external registration. External registration requires a
downstream sensing line.
Principle of Operation
▲ WARNING
Since a pilot-operated regulator is
constructed of both a pilot and a main
valve, do not exceed the maximum inlet
pressure shown on the nameplate.
Letter keys in this section refer to Figure 2 unless
otherwise noted. Fast response and accuracy are
made possible by the amplifying effect of the pilot
and by the two-path control system. The function of
the pilot is to sense change in the controlled pressure
and amplify it into a larger change in the loading
pressure. Any changes in outlet pressure act quickly
on both the actuator diaphragm and the loading pilot,
thus providing the precise pressure control that is
characteristic of a two-path control system.
Upstream or inlet pressure is utilized as the operating
medium, which is reduced through pilot operation to
load the main diaphragm chamber. Tubing connects
the inlet pressure to the pilot. Downstream or outlet
pressure registers underneath the main diaphragm (E)
and on top of pilot diaphragm (F). There are three
different versions of pressure registration for the
299H Series.
Internal registration—Outlet pressure is registered
through the throat (J) to the main diaphragm chamber
and then through a small port (G) to the top of the
pilot diaphragm.
External registration—The throat (J) is blocked and a
downstream control line is connected to the pilot upper
diaphragm chamber or the actuator lower diaphragm
chamber. A small port (G) connects the two chambers.
Dual registration—The lower main diaphragm chamber
registers outlet pressure through the throat (J) and the
upper pilot diaphragm chamber registers downstream
pressure by using a downstream control line. The port (G)
between the chambers is blocked.

5299H Series
Type 299H
In operation, assume the outlet pressure is less than
the setting of the pilot control spring (A). The top side
of pilot diaphragm assembly (F) will have a lower
pressure than the setting of the control spring (A).
The control spring (A) forces the diaphragm assembly
upward, opening the pilot orifice (C). Additional loading
pressure is supplied from the pilot orifice to the top
side of the main diaphragm (E).
This creates a higher pressure on the top side of the
main diaphragm (E) than on the bottom side, forcing
the diaphragm downward. This motion is transmitted
through a lever, which pulls the valve disk (K) open,
allowing inlet pressure to flow through the valve.
When the demand in the downstream system has been
satisfied, the outlet pressure increases. The increased
pressure is transmitted through the downstream control
line (for external or dual registration) or through the
port (G) (for internal registration) and acts on top of the
pilot diaphragm (F). This pressure exceeds the pilot
spring setting and forces the diaphragm down, closing
the orifice (C). The loading pressure acting on the
main diaphragm (E) bleeds to the downstream system
through a bleed restriction (H).
With a decrease in loading pressure on top of the
main diaphragm (E), the main closing spring (B)
exerts an upward force on the diaphragm post which
is connected to the main diaphragm (E), pulling it
upward. This moves the main valve disk (K) toward its
seat, decreasing flow to the downstream system.
Type 299HR
During normal operation the Type 299HR performance
is identical to the Type 299H. If an overpressure
condition occurs, the pilot diaphragm head will
separate from the pilot diaphragm post and travel until
it contacts the pilot spring case. The movement of the
diaphragm head creates a path and a token or small
amount of gas will be released.
When the overpressure condition ceases, the pilot
diaphragm head will return to the diaphragm post and
the regulator will return to normal operation.
Type 299HV
The Type VSX8 (299HV) slam-shut device on the
Type 299HV Regulator is a fast acting slam-shut valve
which provides overpressure or overpressure and
underpressure protection by completely shutting off the
flow of gas to the downstream system.

6299H Series
The slam-shut module’s actions are independent of the
Type 299HV main regulator and of the variations to the
inlet pressure. The Type VSX8 have internal or external
registration. External registration requires a downstream
sensing line.
The slam-shut disk is held in the open position
(reset position) by an internal latching mechanism
that holds the valve stem and disk assembly.
If the pressure below the diaphragm increases
(or decreases) reaching the Type VSX8 setpoint,
the diaphragm will travel upwards (or downwards)
operating a lever which in turn releases the valve
stem assembly.
Once released, the spring force on the stem will push
the stem and disk to the closed position against the seat
shutting off all gas flow. The pilot supply pressure is also
shut off when the Type VSX8 is closed. The manual
reset has an internal bypass to equalize the reset
pressure on either side on the slam-shut disk.
In order for the Underpressure Shutoff (UPSO) of
any slam-shut to be triggered, the downstream pipe
pressure must drop below the UPSO setpoint. In the
case of a downstream line break, numerous factors
can prevent the downstream pipe pressure from
decreasing below the slam-shut UPSO setpoint. These
factors include the distance of pipe to the break, the
diameter of the pipe, size of the break and the number
of restrictions, such as valves, elbows and bends,
downstream of the regulator and/or slam-shut device.
Due to these factors additional protections should be
installed to stop flow in the event of a line break.
Overpressure Protection
Like most regulators, the Type 299H has outlet
pressure ratings lower than the inlet pressure ratings.
Complete downstream overpressure protection is
needed if the actual inlet pressure exceeds the outlet
pressure rating.
Overpressure protection for internal parts is built
into the main and pilot diaphragms by means
of a small spring on each post. The springs will
allow the diaphragm heads to move farther on the
posts avoiding damage to or bending of the valve
trim. Overpressuring any portion of a regulator
or associated equipment may cause leakage,
parts damage or personal injury due to bursting of
pressure-containing parts or explosion of accumulated
gas. Regulator operation within ratings does not
preclude the possibility of damage from external
sources or from debris in the pipeline.
A regulator should be inspected for damage
periodically and after any overpressure condition.
The pilot vent is provided with a 1/4 NPT tapped
connection in the spring case.
Installation
▲ WARNING
Personal injury, equipment damage or
leakage due to escaping gas or bursting
of pressure-containing parts might result
if this regulator is overpressured or is
installed where service conditions could
exceed the limits for which the regulator
was designed or where conditions exceed
any ratings of the adjacent piping or
piping connections. To avoid such injury
or damage, provide pressure-relieving
or pressure-limiting devices (as required
by the appropriate code, regulation or
standard) to prevent service conditions
from exceeding those limits.
A regulator may vent some gas to the
atmosphere in hazardous or flammable
gas service. Vented gas might accumulate
and cause personal injury, death or
property damage due to fire or explosion.
Vent a regulator in hazardous gas service
to a remote, safe location away from air
intakes or any hazardous location. Protect
the vent line or stack opening against
condensation or clogging.
If the regulator is exposed to an
overpressure condition, it should be
inspected for any damage that may have
occurred. Operation below these limits
does not preclude the possibility of
damage from external sources or from
debris in the pipeline.
If the Type VSX8 is exposed to an
overpressure condition, it should be
inspected for any damage that may have
occurred. Operation below these limits
does not preclude the possibility of
damage from external sources or from
debris in the pipeline.
In the case of a downstream line break,
numerous factors affect the capability
to evacuate gas from the pipeline.
7299H Series
These factors include the distance of
pipe to the break, the diameter of the
pipe, size of the break and the number
of restrictions, such as valves, elbows
and bends, downstream of the regulator
and/or slam-shut device. Due to these
factors additional protections should be
installed to stop flow in the event of a
line break.
Like most regulators, the 299H Series regulators have
an outlet pressure rating lower than its inlet pressure
rating. Complete downstream overpressure protection
is needed if the actual inlet pressure can exceed the
regulator outlet pressure rating or the pressure ratings
of any downstream equipment. Regulator operation
within ratings does not preclude the possibility of
damage from external sources or from debris in the
lines. A regulator should be inspected for damage
periodically and after any overpressure condition.
Clean out all pipelines before installation. Check for
damage which might have occurred during shipment.
Also, check for and remove any dirt or foreign material
which may have accumulated in the regulator body.
Apply pipe compound to the external pipe threads of
threaded bodies or use suitable line gaskets and good
bolting practices with a flanged body. This regulator
may be installed in any position desired as long as the
flow through the body is in the direction indicated by the
arrow on the body. Install a three-valve bypass around
the regulator if continuous operation is necessary during
maintenance or inspection.
Although the standard orientation of the actuator and
pilot to the main valve body is as shown in Figure 1,
this orientation may be changed in 90° intervals by
rotating the actuator lower casing (key 1, Figure 4) and
the elbow fitting (key 19) by 90° and then reinstalling
the cap screws.
To keep the pilot spring case from being plugged or the
spring case from collecting moisture, corrosive chemicals
or other foreign material, the vent must be pointed down
oriented to the lowest possible point on the spring case
or otherwise protected. Vent orientation may be changed
by rotating the pilot spring case with respect to the
pilot body.
To remotely vent the pilot, remove the screwed-in vent
assembly (key 27, Figure 3) from the pilot spring case
and install obstruction-free tubing or piping into the
1/4 NPT vent tapping. Provide protection on a remote
vent by installing a screened vent cap into the remote
end of the vent pipe.
An upstream pilot supply line is not required
because of the integral pilot supply tubing
(key 21, Figure 4). However, as long as the 1/4 NPT
tapping in the main valve body is plugged, this
tubing may be disconnected from the main valve
(key 17) in order to install a pilot supply line from a
desired remote location into the pilot.
If using a control line, attach the control line from
the pilot tap 2 to 3 ft. / 0.61 to 0.91 m downstream of
the regulator in a straight run of pipe. If impossible
to comply with this recommendation due to the pipe
arrangement, it may be better to make the control line
tap nearer the regulator outlet rather than downstream
of a block valve. Do not make the tap near any elbow,
swage or nipple which might cause turbulence. For
optimal performance, use as large of a control line
as practical.
In many instances, it will be necessary to enlarge the
downstream piping to keep flow velocities within good
engineering practices. Expand the piping as close to
the regulator outlet as possible.
▲ WARNING
Adjustment of the pilot control spring to
produce an outlet pressure higher than
the upper limit of the outlet pressure
range for that particular spring can cause
personal injury or equipment damage due
to bursting of pressure-containing parts
or the dangerous accumulation of gases
if the maximum actuator emergency
casing pressure is exceeded. If the
desired outlet pressure is not within the
range of the pilot control spring, install a
spring of the proper range according to
the Maintenance section.
Each regulator is factory-set for the pressure setting
specified on the order. If no setting was specified,
the outlet pressure is set midrange of the pilot control
spring. In all cases, check the control spring setting to
make sure it is correct for the application.
Registration Conversion
To convert the 299H Series regulators from one type of
registration to another, all that is required is adding or
removing screws and O-rings.
To change an internal registration regulator to an
external registration regulator with a downstream
control line, block the two ports in the throat with
screws and O-rings (J in Figure 2).
8299H Series
Remove either the 3/4 NPT pipe plug in the pilot
casing or the 3/4 NPT pipe plug in the lower casing
and add a downstream control line.
To convert an external registration regulator to a dual
registration regulator, remove the two screws and
O-rings (J in Figure 2) from the throat and use a screw
and an O-ring to block the port (G in Figure 2) between
the lower diaphragm chamber and pilot diaphragm
chamber. Remove the 3/4 NPT pipe plug in the pilot
lower casing and add a downstream control line.
Type VSX8 Slam-Shut Device
Refer to the Instruction Manual for Type VSX8
Slam-shut, document D103127X012, for Adjustment and
Maintenance of the Slam-shut.
Type VSX8 Installation Startup
Note
The Type VSX8 slam-shut device can
be rotated 360° for easy installation
and maintenance.
Equipment installed downstream the
Type VSX8 slam-shut device can be
damaged if the following procedure
for resetting the Type VSX8 slam-shut
device is not followed. This equipment
includes the integral Type VSX8
regulator configurations.
Before proceeding with the adjustment
of the slam-shut device springs, the
operator must ensure upstream and
downstream valves are closed and
adjusting screws are unscrewed.
With proper installation completed and downstream
equipment properly adjusted, perform the following
procedure while monitoring the pressure with gauges.
1. Very slowly open the upstream block valve.
2. On a Type 299HV, the Type VSX8 is shipped in
the tripped position and will need to be reset. If the
Type VSX8 is OPSO only, it can be reset before
starting the regulator. If the Type VSX8 is OPSO/
UPSO, the regulator will need to be started and
the downstream system pressurized before the
Type VSX8 can be reset. See the section for
Type VSX8 reset.
3. Use the following procedure to reset the
Type VSX8:
a. To properly reset the Type VSX8 slam-shut
after it has been tripped to the closed position,
a flat-head screwdriver must be inserted into
the backside of the reset button.
b. The screwdriver should be slowly rotated to
gradually pull the reset button away from the
Type VSX8 device. This slow movement allows
for a slow bleed of the pressure across the
Type VSX8 slam-shut’s disk and seat area. The
operator should be able to hear the pressure
bleeding through the system.
c. When the pressure has equalized and the
air bleeding sound has dissipated, the reset
button should be pulled completely away from
the Type VSX8 slam-shut device by hand
until the internal shut-off mechanism has
been re-latched.
d. Once the operator feels the click of the re-latch
occurring, the reset button should be pushed
completely back into its original position.
4. Slowly open the hand valve (if used) in the
control line. The regulator will control downstream
pressure at the pilot control spring setting. See
the Adjustment section following these numbered
steps if changes in the setting are necessary
during the start-up procedure.
5. Slowly open the downstream block valve.
6. Slowly close the bypass valve, if used.
7. Check all connections for leaks.
299H Series Adjustment
Keys are referenced in Figure 5. The only adjustment
on a 299H Series regulator is the reduced pressure
setting of the pilot control spring (key 32). Remove
the closing cap (key 29) and turn the adjusting screw
(key 36). Turning the adjusting screw clockwise into
the spring case increases the controlled or reduced
pressure setting. Turning the screw counterclockwise
decreases the reduced pressure setting. Always
tighten the locknut (key 35) and replace the closing
cap after making adjustments.
9299H Series
Shutdown
Installation arrangements may vary, but in any installation
it is important to open and close valves slowly and the
outlet pressure be vented before venting inlet pressure to
prevent damage caused by reverse pressurization of the
regulator. Isolate the regulator from the system. Vent the
downstream pressure; then vent inlet pressure to release
any remaining pressure in the regulator.
Maintenance
Regulator parts are subject to normal wear and must
be inspected periodically and replaced as necessary.
The frequency of inspection and replacement depends
upon the severity of service conditions and upon
applicable codes and government regulations.
Due to the care Emerson takes in meeting all
manufacturing requirements (heat treating,
dimensional tolerances, etc.), use only replacement
parts manufactured or furnished by Emerson.
▲ WARNING
Avoid personal injury or damage
to property from sudden release
of pressure or uncontrolled gas or
other process fluid. Before starting
to disassemble, carefully release all
pressures according to the Shutdown
procedure. Use gauges to monitor inlet,
loading and outlet pressures while
releasing these pressures.
On reassembly of the regulator, it is recommended
that a good quality pipe thread sealant be applied to
pressure connections and fittings and a good quality
lubricant be applied to all O-rings. Also apply an anti-
seize compound to the adjusting screw threads and
other areas as needed.
Note
The regulator body may remain in the
pipeline during maintenance procedures.
Main Actuator Diaphragm
Follow this procedure to change the actuator
diaphragm or to inspect, clean or replace any other
parts in the main actuator. Part key numbers are
referenced in Figures 3 and 4.
1. Cut the wire seal (key 68) (being careful not to
lose the warning tag) and remove the closing cap
(key 3). Inspect the O-ring (key 9) and replace
if necessary.
2. Carefully loosen and remove the double nuts
(key 5) on the actuator diaphragm post (key 10).
When removing the adjusting nuts, do not twist
or unscrew the diaphragm post, as this action will
loosen the joint between the diaphragm post and
the pusher post (keys 10 and 11).
3. Remove the spring seat (key 4) and closing
spring (key 6).
