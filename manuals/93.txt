INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE INSTRUCTIONS
Before installation, these instructions must be carefully read and understood.
WARNING
Removal of the seal wires in an attempt to adjust
and/or repair this product by unauthorized or
unqualified persons voids the product warranty
and may cause damage to equipment and serious
injury or death to persons.
The product is a safety related component
intended for use in critical applications. The
improper application, installation or maintenance
of the product or the use of parts or components
not manufactured by Anderson Greenwood may
result in a failure of the product.
SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
When the pressure relief valve is under pressure
never place any part of your body near the pilot
exhaust nor the outlet of the main valve.
The main valve outlet should be piped or vented
to a safe location.
Always wear proper safety gear to protect
head, eyes, ears, etc. anytime you are near
pressurized valves.
Never attempt to remove the pressure relief
valve from a system that is pressurized.
Never make adjustments to or perform
maintenance on the pressure relief valve while
in service unless the valve is isolated from
the system pressure. If not properly isolated
from the system pressure, the pressure relief
valve may inadvertently open resulting in
serious injury.
Remove the pressure relief valve prior to
performing any pressure testing of the system.
The safety of lives and property often depends
on the proper operation of the pressure relief
valve. The valve must be maintained according
to appropriate instructions and must be
periodically tested and reconditioned to ensure
correct function.
STORAGE AND HANDLING
Pressure relief valve performance may be
adversely affected if the valve is stored for an
extended period without proper protection.
Rough handling and dirt may damage, deform,
or cause misalignment of valve parts and may
alter the pressure setting and adversely affect
valve performance and seat tightness.
It is recommended that the valve be stored in
the original shipping container in a warehouse
or as a minimum on a dry surface with a
protective covering until installation. Inlet and
outlet protectors should remain in place until
the valve is ready to be installed in the system.

1 GENERAL VALVE DESCRIPTION AND
START-UP
1.1 Operation
The Anderson Greenwood Pilot Operated Safety
Relief Valves utilize the principle of backloading the top of a differential area diaphragm
with line pressure to hold the diaphragm
closed up to set pressure. At set pressure the
pilot valve relieves, partially evacuating the
dome (volume above the diaphragm) and the
seat assembly lifts permitting discharge from
the main valve. When the pilot reseats, line
pressure is diverted to the dome closing the
main valve.

ANDERSON GREENWOOD SERIES 93 POSITIVE PRESSURE POSRV
INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE INSTRUCTIONS
1.3 Start-up
There must be pressure at the valve inlet
to establish a differential in force across
the diaphragm and “load” it in the closed
position. Pressure must pass through the pilot
supply tube and pilot and exert force on the
diaphragm. On normal start-up the valve loads
itself without incident as pressure increases.
Block valves are often used under safety valves
in order to isolate them when maintenance
is required. When putting the safety valve in
service be sure the block valve is fully opened.
If the block valve is opened after system startup, the safety valve may briefly vent to the
atmosphere before the dome gets pressurized.
It will then close.
2 MAIN VALVE MAINTENANCE (REFER TO
FIGURES 2 AND 2A)
2.1 Valve configuration
Two different valve internals are used in the
main valve, depending on set pressure. The
sponge seat is used for the set pressures
shown above. The O-ring seat with guide is
used for all pressures above these values. For
some applications, a guide may be used in
place of Item 11 with a sponge seat.
SET PRESSURES WHERE SPONGE SEAT
IS USED
Valve size Set pressure (psig)
2 x 3 Below 2.5 psig
3 x 4 Below 1.5 psig
4 x 6 Below 1.0 psig
6 x 8 Below 1.0 psig
8 x10 Below 1.0 psig
10 x12 Below 1.0 psig
12 x16 Below 1.0 psig
2.2 Disassembly
Disconnect the supply tube from the pilot,
remove the cap bolts, lift the cap from the valve
body and lift the diaphragm, seat and guide
(where used) from the valve. Remove the seat
bolt(s) to separate the diaphragm from the
seat, guide, and retainer plates.

2.3 Repair
Inspect the nozzle seating area for nicks or
scratches. If they cannot be removed with
crocus cloth or fine sandpaper, the nozzle must
be remachined. On steel valves the nozzle
may be removed from the body. Machining of
the nozzles should be limited to .06” material
removal.
2.4 Assembly
Reassemble the diaphragm, seat guide,
and pilot supply tube in the reverse order of
disassembly. Apply a light film of lubricant to
all threaded parts. Care should be taken to
adequately tighten the seat bolt(s) on those
valves with guides to prevent the diaphragm
from pulling away from the bolt under
pressure.
On valves with sponge seats (no guide), the
seat bolt need not be tightened as much since
these valves are used at lower pressures and
excessive tightening will distort the seat.
Carefully insert the guide (where used) squarely
into the nozzle and lower the diaphragm
assembly into place. Align the holes on the
diaphragm O.D. with those on the body.
1.2 Installation
Both inlet and outlet may be standard ANSI or
DIN flange connections and are to be installed
in accordance with accepted piping practices.
The installed position of the safety valve should
be in the upright position as shown in Figure 1.
When remote pressure pick-up is used the pilot
supply tube is connected to a remote location
rather than to the inlet neck of the valve. If a
block valve is used in the remote pilot supply
line, be sure it is opened before pressurizing
the system.
Note: remote pressure pick-up piping must
have the equivalent flow area of ½” tubing for
lengths up to 20 feet. For lengths greater than
20 feet, larger tubing or pipe should be used.
For valves supplied with eyebolts, follow the
instructions in Anderson Greenwood Pilot
operated safety relief valves 05-9040-352
(VCOSI-06034 Operating and Safety
Instructions) pertaining to the safe use and
storage of eyebolts.
Refer to Anderson Greenwood Pilot operated
safety relief valves 05-9040-372 (VCIOM-03099
Winterization Guidelines) and 05-9040-352
for more information regarding Winterization
requirements.
The guide spring, Item 3, is used to create
frictional drag to prevent valve chatter caused
by excessive inlet piping pressure losses. The
tension of these springs is correct when the
diaphragm/guide assembly slowly free falls to
the closed position. If the assembly will not do
this, adjust the spring tension by bending the
tail or lower half of the spring.
Refer to paragraph 8 for Soft goods repair kits.

FIGURES 3 AND 4)
3.1 Disassembly
To facilitate assembly, place all parts removed
in an orderly arrangement so the correct parts
are assembled in the proper sequence. Refer to
Figure 3 for parts description and location.
3.1.1 Begin by removing spring bonnet
(Remove the spring compression before
attempting to removing bonnet).
Remove case bolts and upper case.
Loosen tube fittings on boost tube at
lower case and body. Remove spindle
nut while holding hex spacer. Remove
diaphragms, sense and boost plates
and spacers. Remove lower case
and spindle/seat assembly. Remove
blowdown adjustment screw and supply
port tube fitting.
Note: shim washers (33) may be in
assembly to accomplish proper stack
height. If so, note location and quantity.
3.2 Assembly
Assembly is done in the reverse order of
disassembly.
Lubricate all screw threads and end of spring
adjusting screw that bears against spring
washer. Use Down Corning No. 33 Silicone
grease or equivalent. When assembling pilot,
the following should be observed:
3.2.1 Place seat/spindle assembly (11) into
pilot body.
Install spindle spacer (32) on top of shim
washers. Lay straight edge across pilot
body (14) and check gap between spindle
spacer and straight edge. Add or remove
shim washers (33) as required to have
top of spindle spacer (32) even with top of
body (14).
3.1.2 Clean all parts and replace all soft
goods. The spindle/seat assembly
is factory assembled and must be
replaced as a unit. If the nozzle is nicked
or scratched, it should be replaced.
To remove it, use a deep socket.

be aligned with all holes in the body.
The small hole in lower case must be
aligned with hole in the body. Two of the
six case bolts for the medium pressure
pilot (Figure 4) must be assembled
though holes in the lower case before it
is attached to the body. After attachment
there is insufficient clearance to do so.
3.2.3 For the medium pressure pilot the hole
in the boost (lower) diaphragm and
spacer ring must be aligned with boost
tube port in lower case. The hole in the
upper diaphragm must be positioned
away from boost tube part.

4 PILOT ADJUSTMENT
4.1 General
Two adjustments are provided; one for varying
the pressure at which the pilot opens and
one for varying the pressure at which the
pilot closes. The first adjustment controls the
“set” or “popping” pressure, the second the
“reseat” or “blowdown” pressure. To adjust set
pressure, a test set-up similar to that shown in
Figure 5 should be used.
4.2 Set pressure
This adjustment is obtained by turning the
pressure adjusting bolt, clockwise (in) to
increase set pressure and counterclockwise
(out) to decrease set pressure.
4.3 Reseat pressure
This adjustment is obtained by turning
the blowdown needle adjusting screw,
clockwise (in) to increase blowdown,
counterclockwise (out) to decrease blowdown.
A small interaction between set pressure
and reseat pressure adjustments will occur,
therefore it may be necessary to readjust the
set pressure after setting reseat pressure.
Note: if the blowdown adjusting screw has been
moved or turned to either extreme, positioning
it midway will aid in obtaining the correct
blowdown. There are approximately 7 to 8 turns
to obtain full travel of the adjustment.
Midway from either end should produce a
blowdown for “snap action”. For “modulating
pilot action”, back the adjustment screw out
(counter-clockwise) to obtain the adjustment
limits given in paragraph 4.5.
4.4 Range of adjustment
All pilots can be adjusted + 10% beyond the
nameplate setting.

NOTES
1. Snap action - dome pressure decreases rapidly with a “snap” to 15% ± 10% of set pressure at set pressure.
Pilot seat should be bubble tight at dome pressure recovery.
Modulating action - dome pressure decreases slowly to 30% ± 5% of set pressure and recovers to 60% ± 10%
of set pressure at set pressure.
2. Adjust set pressure on test stand to 101% ± 1% of nameplate setting to allow for spring tension relaxation
caused by compression of the elastomer in the diaphragm stack.
3. Pilot seat should be bubble tight at dome recovery for “snap” pilot action and at 90% of set pressure for
“modulating” pilot action for valves set above 7”WC. For valves set 7”WC and below, the pilot seat shall be
bubble tight at 75% of set pressure.

INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE INSTRUCTIONS
5 ACCESSORY REPAIR
5.1 Check valve
A check valve is used in the pressure sense
line to the pilot when the safety valve is
equipped with a field test or backflow preventer
accessory. A check valve is also installed
between the pilot dome connection and main
valve when the safety relief valve is equipped
with a backflow preventer.
The check valve used in the pressure sense line
is shown in Figure 6. This type of check valve is
also used for the backflow preventer accessory
between the pilot dome connection
and main valve for set pressures below
15 psig. The diaphragm is the only part that
should require servicing. If the diaphragm
is to be replaced, care should be taken not
to scratch or distort it in the center nozzle
sealing area. When reassembling the check
valve, uniformly tighten the body bolts, first one
side, then the opposite side until all are tight.
DO NOT OVERTIGHTEN bolts as this will distort
the diaphragm and cause leakage. For set
pressures below 1.0 psig, a diaphragm gasket,
Item 9, may be used between the diaphragm
and lower body. If the check valve has one,
replace it with a new one.
If the check valve is not equipped with one,
do not put one in.

6 LEAK TESTING ASSEMBLY
6.1 General
The complete valve assembly should be leak
tested for internal and external leaks using a
pressure equal to 30% and 90% of set.
6.2 Internal leak test
Cover valve outlet with wet piece of paper and
observe paper for movement. Any outward
movement indicates a leak. If leakage is
detected, remove paper and spray leak test
solution around nozzle/seat to locate leak.
Leakage my be caused by damaged seat
sealing surface or improper squeeze of O-ring
or sponge seat.
6.3 External leak test
Following the internal leak test, check for
external leakage by applying leak test solution
to all joints and seals. Tighten bolts or fittings
as required.
7 PILOT SET PRESSURE FIELD TEST
PROCEDURE
7.1 General
The pilot set pressure can be checked in the
field by applying an external test pressure to
the pilot through the field test hand valve as
shown in Figure 7.
Note: if the process pressure at the time of test
is less than approximately 30% of the pilot set
pressure, the main valve will not open. If the
process pressure is greater than 30% and the
main valve must remain closed,
temporarily replace the pilot exhaust vent with
an orifice plug having an orifice diameter of
.040”/.060”. This orifice must be removed on
completion of field testing as it prevents the
main valve from opening.
7.2 Procedure
A. Connect test gas bottle as shown in
Figure 7.
B. Close vent valve “C”.
C. Open field test valve “B”. Test gauge will
read process pressure.
D. Open block valve “A” SLOWLY to increase
pressure until pilot “pops”. The set pressure
will be the pressure indicated on the test
gauge at the time of pop.
E. To remove test set up, close valves “A” and
“B”, open valve “C”.
