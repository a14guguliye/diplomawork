Type 310A
Principle of Operation
Single-Pilot Regulator (Figure 2)
The regulator inlet pressure enters the pilot through
the external pilot supply line and is utilized as the
supply pressure for the pilot. The setting of the
pilot control spring determines the reduced outlet
(downstream) pressure.
In operation, assume the outlet pressure is less than
the setting of the pilot control spring. Pilot control
spring force then overcomes the force resulting from
outlet pressure acting on the bottom diaphragm.
The spring pushes the diaphragm plate and yoke
assembly away from the relay seat, opening it and
supplying additional loading pressure to the main
valve diaphragm. When this additional loading
pressure exceeds the force resulting from outlet
pressure acting on the main valve diaphragm plus
the force of the main valve spring, the diaphragm
is pushed away from the stationary valve plug. The
throttling sleeve opens wider and the required gas is
supplied to the downstream system.
When gas demand in the downstream system has
been satisfied, the outlet pressure tends to increase.
The increased outlet pressure acting on the bottom
diaphragm of the diaphragm plate and yoke assembly
results in a force that overcomes the pilot spring
setting and forces the assembly toward the relay
seat, closing it. The loading pressure acting on the
main valve diaphragm bleeds to the downstream
system through the fixed restriction in the diaphragm
plate and yoke assembly. When rapid main valve
closure is required by unusual control conditions,
the bleed valve opens for increased bleed rate. The
force of increased outlet pressure acting on the main
valve diaphragm plus the main valve spring force
overcomes the force of decreased loading pressure
acting on the main valve diaphragm and moves the
throttling sleeve toward the stationary valve plug to
decrease the gas flow to the downstream system.
The top diaphragm in the pilot acts as a sealing
member for the loading chamber and as a
balancing member to the bottom diaphragm. The
two diaphragms are connected by a machine yoke.
Pressure change to the center chamber has little
effect on the positioning of the valve disk.

Monitor Systems
Wide-Open Monitors (Figure 5)
Monitoring regulators serve as overpressure protection
devices to limit system pressure in the event of failure
of working regulators feeding the system. The control
line of a wide-open monitoring regulator may be
connected downstream of the working regulator, so
that during normal operation the wide-open monitoring
regulator is standing wide-open with the pressure
reduction being taken across the working regulator.
Only in case of working regulator failure does the
wide-open monitoring regulator function.
Working Monitors (Figure 3)
The Type 310A-32A-32A differs from wide-open
monitors in that it has working monitor capability. This
means that it normally reduces pressure and throttles
while the second-stage regulator is in operation. Should
the second-stage working regulator fail open, the
Type 310A-32A-32A will take over the entire pressure
reduction function.
The working monitor pilots are adaptations of two
Type 32A pilots with special internal parts, due to the
pressure conditions in this piloting system. A spacer
blocks open the differential regulator portion of the
Type 32A monitoring pilot. A plug in both the working
and monitoring pilots makes the internal bleed non-
functional. A restriction placed in the external tubing
between the diaphragm loading pressure and the
intermediate pressure acts as a downstream bleed.
If the second-stage working regulator fails open,
the distribution pressure increases to the setting of
the Type 32A monitoring pilot (slightly higher than
the original distribution pressure) and is controlled
at that level by the Type 310A-32A-32A. Thus,
downstream equipment is protected against a major
overpressure condition without disrupting service or
venting gas to atmosphere.

Type 310A
WARNING
Installation and Startup
Personal injury or equipment damage,
due to bursting of pressure-containing
parts may result if this regulator is
overpressured or is installed where
service conditions could exceed the
limits given in the Specifications section
and on the appropriate nameplate or
where conditions exceed any rating of the
adjacent piping or piping connections.
To avoid such injury or damage, provide
pressure-relieving or pressure-limiting
devices to prevent service conditions
from exceeding those limits. Also, check
that the installation is in compliance with
all applicable codes and regulations.
In the working pilot, the inlet pressure is reduced
to a pre-determined pilot supply pressure, which is
further reduced to loading pressure for the Type 310A
diaphragm. The loading pressure is piped through the
portion of the monitoring pilot blocked open by the
spacer and, as long as distribution pressure is below
the setting of the monitoring pilot, passes through the
relay orifice of the monitoring pilot to the diaphragm
case of the Type 310A body.
Distribution pressure is piped back to the monitoring
pilot. As long as the distribution pressure is less
than the monitoring pilot setting, the working pilot
controls the Type 310A to maintain intermediate
pressure. If the distribution pressure increases to
the monitoring pilot setting, the monitoring pilot relay
orifice starts to throttle the loading pressure to the
Type 310A diaphragm. This allows the Type 310A
main spring to move the throttling sleeve closer
to the seat and control distribution pressure at the
monitoring pilot setpoint. Therefore, failure of the
second-stage working regulator is controlled with
only a slight increase in distribution pressure, with
the Type 310A-32A-32A accomplishing the entire
pressure reduction function.
Additionally, physical damage to the
regulator could break the pilot off the
main valve, causing personal injury
and property damage due to bursting
of pressure-containing parts. To avoid
such injury and damage, install the
regulator in a safe location.
Note
For the installation of the regulator in the
line, please consider that SLIP-ON flange
gaskets need to be used on the inlet of all
Type 310A regulators, from NPS 1 to 6 /
DN 25 to 150. The gaskets for the outlet
of the Type 310A are standard CL600 RF
welding-neck flange gaskets.
Single-Pilot Regulator
Installation
A Type 310A-32A regulator bleeds no gas to
atmosphere during normal operation, thus making
the regulator suitable for installation in pits and
other enclosed locations without elaborate venting
systems. This regulator also can be installed in pits
subject to flooding by venting the pilot spring case
above the expected flood level so that the pilot setting
can be referenced to atmospheric pressure.
1. Use qualified personnel when installing,
maintaining or operating this regulator. Inspect the
regulator and the pipeline to be certain both are
free of foreign materials.
2. Install the regulator so that the flow arrow cast
on the main valve matches the flow direction of
process fluid through the regulator.
3. Apply pipe compound to the male pipeline
threads before installing a regulator with NPT end
connections. Use gaskets between pipeline and
regulator flanges when installing a regulator with
flanged end connections.

A regulator may vent some gas to
the atmosphere. In hazardous or
flammable gas service, vented gas
may accumulate, causing personal
injury, death or property damage
due to bursting of pressure-retaining
parts. Vent a regulator in hazardous
gas service to a remote, safe location
away from air intakes or any hazardous
location. The vent line or stack opening
must be protected against condensation
or clogging.
4. A Type 32A pilot has a 1/4 NPT vent connection
in the spring case. To remotely vent gas from
the spring case, remove the screened vent and
connect 1/4 in. / 6.4 mm piping or tubing to the
spring case connection.
The piping or tubing should vent to a safe
location, have as few elbows as possible and
have a screened vent on its exhaust. Install the
regulator and any remote vent piping or tubing
so that the vent is protected from condensation,
freezing or any substance that could clog it.
5. Connect a pilot supply line from the upstream
piping to the 1/4 NPT pilot inlet.
6. Connect a downstream control line to a straight
run of pipe 6 to 10 pipe diameters from the
regulator outlet as shown in Figure 4. If such a
distance is not practical, connect the control line
away from elbows, swages, nipples or any area
where abnormal flow velocities occur.
7. Install a hand valve in the control line.
8. Install the other end of the downstream control
line to the 1/2 NPT connection in either side of the
case body (key 1).
9. Consult the appropriate Instruction Manual for
installation of an optional pneumatic or electric
remote control-drive unit. For optional remote
pneumatic loading of a Type 32A pilot, make the
spring case piping connections just as they would
be made for remote venting.
Prestartup Considerations
Each regulator is factory-set for the outlet pressure
specified on the order. If no setting was specified,
outlet pressure was factory-set at the mid-range of
the pilot control spring. Before beginning the startup
procedure in this section, make sure the following
conditions are in effect:
• Block valves isolate the regulator
• Vent valves are closed
• A bypass, if any, is in operation
In all cases, check the control spring setting to make
sure it is correct for the application.

CAUTION
CAUTION
Pilot supply pressure must be
introduced into the regulator before
introduction of any downstream
pressure or internal damage may occur
due to reverse pressurization of the pilot
and main valve components.
Pressure gauges should always be used
to monitor downstream pressure during
startup. Procedures used in putting this
regulator into operation must be planned
accordingly if the downstream system is
pressurized by another regulator or by a
manual bypass.
Note
Pilot supply pressure must be at least
15 psig / 1.0 bar greater than control
pressure to operate the regulator at
rated travel.
Although remote loading or control constructions
may require separate adjustments on associated
equipment, the only adjustment normally necessary
on a Type 310A-32A regulator is the pressure setting
of the pilot control spring. Turning the adjusting
screw clockwise into the spring case increases the
spring compression and pressure setting. Turning
the adjusting screw counterclockwise decreases the
spring compression and pressure setting.
Pilot Adjustment
To adjust a standard Type 32A pilot, loosen the locknut
(key 4) and turn the adjusting screw (key 3). Then
tighten the locknut to maintain the adjustment position.
Startup
1. Open the upstream block (isolating) valve. Open
hand valve A in the external pilot supply line
before opening the downstream isolating valve
(See Figure 4).
2. Open the downstream block (isolating) valve for
minimum flow.
3. Slowly open hand valve B in the downstream
control line, while at the same time adjusting the
pilot setting, if necessary.
4. Completely open the downstream block valve.
5. Slowly close the bypass valve, if any.
Wide-Open Monitor Regulator
Installation
1. For both the wide-open monitoring regulator and
the working regulator, perform the Single-Pilot
Regulator Installation procedures through step 9.
2. Connect the control line of a wide-open monitoring
regulator (Figure 5) to downstream piping near
the working regulator control line connection.
During normal operation the wide-open monitoring
regulator stands wide-open with the pressure
reduction being taken across the working
regulator. Only in case of working regulator failure
does the wide-open monitoring regulator take
control at its slightly higher setting.
Prestartup Considerations
Each regulator is factory-set for the outlet pressure
specified on the order. If no setting was specified,
outlet pressure was factory-set at the mid-range of
the pilot control spring. Before beginning the startup
procedures in this section, make sure the following
conditions are in effect:
• Block valves isolate the regulator
• Vent valves are closed
• Hand valves are closed
• A bypass, if any, is in operation
In all cases, check the control spring setting to make
sure it is correct for the application.
Introduce pilot supply pressure into
the regulator before introducing any
downstream pressure or internal
damage may occur due to reverse
pressurization of the pilot and main
valve components.
Always use pressure gauges to monitor
downstream pressure during startup.
If the downstream is pressurized
by another regulator, plan startup
procedures accordingly.
Note
Pilot supply pressure must exceed
control pressure by at least 15 psig /
1.0 bar in order to operate the regulator
at rated travel.
Although remote loading or control constructions
may require separate adjustments on associated
equipment, the only adjustment normally necessary
on a Type 310A-32A regulator is the pressure setting
of the pilot control spring. Turning the adjusting
screw clockwise into the spring case increases the
spring compression and pressure setting. Turning
the adjusting screw counterclockwise decreases the
spring compression and pressure setting.
Pilot Adjustment
To adjust a standard Type 32A pilot, loosen the locknut
(key 4) and turn the adjusting screw (key 3). Then
tighten the locknut to maintain the adjustment position.
Startup
This procedure is to be repeated in turn for each
regulator in the installation.
1. Slowly open the hand valve in the pilot supply line.
2. Slowly open the upstream block (isolating) valve
and partially open the downstream block valve for
minimum flow.
3. Slowly open the hand valve in the control line
while, at the same time, adjusting the pilot
setting if necessary.
4. Completely open the downstream block valve.
5. Slowly close the bypass valve, if any.
Working Monitor Regulator
Installation
All Type 310A-32A-32A working monitor regulators
are bench set at the factory according to the service
conditions specified on the customer’s order. Examine
the unit on arrival to make sure no damage has occurred
in shipment. Clean and blow out pipelines to be sure no
welding slag or other foreign material is present.
Install the Type 310A-32A-32A into the pipeline using
adequate gaskets for flanged regulator units and good
piping technique. Be sure to provide suitable pressure
gauges where appropriate, block valves, bypass
valves and piping and bleed valves to permit safe
and easy maintenance of both the working monitor
regulator and the second-stage working regulator. Be
sure flow will be in the direction indicated by the arrow
cast on the body.
Refer to the Figure 6 schematic and Figure 12 and
proceed in the following steps.
1. Attach the intermediate pressure control line
(1/2 NPT pipe) between the 1/2 NPT pipe tee
(key 72) and the intermediate pressure portion
of the downstream piping. Install hand valve B in
this line.
2. Connect 1/2 NPT distribution pressure control
line piping between the 1/2 NPT connection in
the mounting bracket (key 45) and the pipeline
downstream of the second-stage working
regulator. Include hand valve A in this control line.
Note
Each pilot has a nameplate identifying it
as the working or monitor pilot.
3. Pipe the pilot supply line to 1/4 NPT connection in
the back of the working pilot body. Supply pressure
should be filtered if excess dirt or condensate is
present in the supply gas.
4. Install downstream working regulator per guidelines.

Type 310A
CAUTION
Startup
1. Before introducing any pressure to the unit,
close hand valve A in the distribution pressure
control line and hand valve B in the intermediate
pressure control line.
Pilot supply pressure must be
introduced into the regulator prior
to introduction of any downstream
pressure or internal damage may occur
due to reverse pressurization of the
pilot and main valve components. Pilot
supply pressure must be at least 15 psi /
1.0 bar greater than control pressure for
proper operation.
2. Slowly open the hand valve in the pilot supply line.
3. Slowly open the upstream block valve and partially
open the downstream block valve for minimum flow.
4. Slowly open hand valve B and allow the
intermediate pressure to increase to the working
pilot setting.
5. Put the second-stage working regulator into
operation according to recommended procedures
and instructions furnished with the second-stage
working regulator.
6. After the distribution pressure has been established
slowly open hand valve A.
Pilot Adjustment
The second-stage working regulator must be set to
operate at a lower pressure than the monitoring pilot
or the monitoring pilot will try to take control of the
distribution pressure. Follow the steps listed to obtain
the desired results.
1. Increase the setting of the monitoring pilot by
loosening the locknut (key 4) and turning the
adjusting screw (key 3) clockwise (into the spring
case cap, key 2) until the working pilot is in control
of the intermediate pressure and the second-stage
working regulator is in control of the distribution
pressure.
2. Adjust the setting of the working pilot by loosening
the jam nut and turning the adjusting screw
clockwise (into the spring case cap) to increase the
intermediate pressure or counterclockwise (out of
the spring case cap) to reduce the intermediate
pressure. Adjust until desired intermediate
pressure is reached.
3. Adjust the second-stage working regulator to
the desired distribution pressure by following
instructions for that particular regulator.
4. Adjust the setting of the monitoring pilot to
establish the desired emergency distribution
pressure, which is to be maintained in the event of
failure of the second-stage working regulator. The
steps followed may vary with each piping situation.
The basic method remains the same.
The following procedure serves as an example which
can be used or modified to make monitoring pilot
adjustments in any installation.

WARNING
Increase the outlet pressure setting of the second-stage
working regulator until the monitoring pilot takes control
of the distribution pressure. Adjust the monitoring pilot
setting until the desired emergency distribution pressure
is achieved. Refer to Table 2 for the recommended
minimum differential between the monitoring pilot
setting and the desired distribution pressure.
With settings as desired on both the monitoring and the
working pilots, tighten the locknuts (key 4) to maintain
proper adjustment screw positions. Then re-adjust
the second-stage working regulator to the desired
distribution pressure.
Shutdown
In any installation it is important to slowly open and
close the valves and to vent the outlet pressure before
venting the inlet pressure to prevent damage caused
by reverse pressurization of the pilot or main valve.
Single-Pilot Regulators and Wide-Open
Monitor Regulators
As well as applying to a single-pilot regulator (Figure 4),
the steps in this procedure also are valid for a wide-open
monitoring installation (Figure 5) and should be repeated
for each regulator in such an installation.
1. Close the upstream isolating valve.
2. Close block valve A (Figure 4) in the supply line.
3. Close the downstream isolating valve.
4. If the downstream control line taps into the
pipeline above the downstream isolating
valve, open vent valve C between the regulator
and the downstream isolating valve. Permit all
pressure to bleed out of the regulator.
If the downstream control line taps into the
pipeline below the downstream isolating valve,
close hand valve B. Then open vent valve C and
vent valve D, permitting all pressure to bleed out of
the regulator.
5. Open vent valve E to release any inlet pressure
that may be trapped in the regulator.
Working Monitor Regulators
1. Close the upstream isolating valve.
2. Close hand valve in pilot supply line.
3. Close the downstream isolating valve.
4. Open a bleed valve between the second-stage
working regulator and the downstream isolating
valve. Permit all pressure to bleed out of the
working monitor regulator and the second-stage
working regulator.
5. Open vent valve to vent any intermediate pressure
trapped in the system.
6. Open vent valve to release any inlet pressure
trapped in the regulator.
Maintenance
The regulator parts are subject to normal wear
and must be inspected periodically and replaced
as necessary. The frequency of inspection and
replacement depends on the severity of service
conditions and on applicable federal, state and local
codes and regulations.
To avoid personal injury or property
damage from sudden release of pressure,
isolate the regulator from the pressure
system and release all pressure from the
pilot and main valve before performing
maintenance operations.
Type 32A Pilots
This procedure describes how the pilot can be
completely disassembled and assembled. When
inspection or repairs are required, disassemble only
those parts necessary to accomplish the job. Refer to
Figures 7 and 12 for key numbers.
Disassembly
The pilot may remain on the main valve for steps 1
through 7; however, it must be removed for steps 8
through 15.
1. Remove the piston seat assembly (key 28) from
the piston guide (key 23).
2. Remove the piston guide (key 23) from the pilot
body (key 22).
3. Check the O-rings (keys 25 and 26) and replace if

(key 16). Unscrew the bleed valve (key 20).
On Single-Pilot Regulators and Wide-Open Monitor
Regulators, remove the bleed valve seat (key 19), the
spring (key 35) and the valve disk (key 18). Check that
the holes drilled in the side of the bleed valve seat and
the adaptor are both clean and unplugged.
On Working Monitor Regulators, make sure the plug
(key 52) is firmly in place.
16. Unscrew the cap nut and nut (keys 10 and 21),
remove the diaphragm plates (key 8) and washers
(key 15) and inspect the diaphragms (key 9).
Note
The edges of the diaphragms can be
expected to curl up. They will flatten out
within a few minutes depending on the
temperature. Warming them will help,
but do not exceed 150°F / 66°C.
Assembly
It is recommended that new diaphragms and O-rings
be installed during assembly. If these parts are to be
reused, be sure that they are carefully inspected and
that no damage has occurred. Lubricate all O-rings.
1. Place the O-ring (key 34) in the piston guide
(key 23).
2. Install the O-rings (keys 25 and 26) on the
piston guide.
3. Install the O-ring (key 30) on the piston (key 29).
4. On single-pilot regulators and wide-open
monitor regulators, place the spring (key 36) in
the piston guide (key 23). Install the piston and
secure with the retaining ring (key 27).
On working monitor regulators, place
the spring (key 36 - working pilot) or spacer
(key 53 - monitoring pilot) in the piston guide.
Install the piston and secure it in the piston guide
with the retaining ring (key 27).
5. Install the O-ring (key 13) on the piston seat
assembly (key 28) and screw the assembly into
the piston guide.
6. Install the piston guide in the pilot body (key 22).
7. Insert the bleed valve (key 20) through the bleed
valve seat (key 19).
8. Install the spring (key 35) and valve disk assembly
(key 18) onto the bleed valve (key 20).
Be sure the bleed valve seat is centered
in the yoke while installing the adaptor.
9. Place the above assembly in the yoke (key 16)
and screw on the adaptor (key 17).

Type 310A
CAUTION
CAUTION
Each diaphragm (key 9) has one
side coated with rubber. Install the
diaphragms so that the rubber sides
face each other. If the diaphragms are
installed any other way, the pilot will not
work properly.
10. Place the diaphragm (key 9), diaphragm plate
(key 8) and sealing washer (key 15) on the yoke
and secure with the cap screw (key 10).
11. Place the other diaphragm, diaphragm plate and
sealing washer on the adaptor and secure with
the nut (key 21).
12. Insert this entire assembly through the
diaphragm spacer (key 11) until the outer edges of
both diaphragms are in place on the spacer.
13. Fit the O-rings (key 14) on the orifice
assembly(key 12).
14. Rotate the yoke to receive the orifice assembly.
15. Place entire assembly on the pilot body (key 22).
To avoid crushing the diaphragm, do not
exceed the torque specified in step 16.
16. Apply lubricant to cap screws (key 6). Insert
the cap screws in the spring case (key 1)
and pilot body and tighten the cap screws to
25 to 30 ft-lbs / 34 to 41 N•m.
17. If removed, install the spring seats (key 5) and
the control spring (key 37).
18. Install the cover gasket (key 7), spring case cap
(key 2), adjusting screw (key 3) and locknut
(key 4).
19. Install the pilot into the main valve using the pipe
nipple (not shown).
20. Connect the loading tubing from the male elbow on
the base body (key 2) to the connector on the side
of the pilot. Refer to Figure 1 for the assembled
location of the tubing, elbow and connector.
Type 310A Main Valve
This procedure describes how to completely
disassemble and assemble a main valve. When
inspection or repairs are required, disassemble only
those parts necessary to accomplish the job; then start
the assembly at the appropriate step. Key numbers
are referenced in Figures 8 and 9.
Disassembly
1. Disconnect the loading tubing from the
connection in the base body (key 2). Disconnect
the downstream pressure control line from the
connection in the case body (key 1) and the
external supply line from the pilot.
2. Remove the main valve from the pipeline.
3. Remove the cap screws (key 14) and separate the
case body (key 1) from the base body (key 2).
Note
If a body gasket (key 29) is not present,
one must be installed when a new
diaphragm is installed. Also, if the
soft seat inside the sleeve (key 3) is
damaged, the sleeve (key 3), washer or
O-ring (key 11), disk retainer (key 12),
disk (key 27) and disk holder (key 28)
need to be replaced.
4. Slide the sleeve and diaphragm assembly out of
the case body (key 1).
5. Inspect the seating area of the sleeve for nicks
and erosion damage. Inspect the diaphragm
(key 6) for damage.
6. Remove the cap screw (key 10), disk retainer
(key 12), disk holder (key 28), O-ring or washer
(key 11). Examine the disk and O-ring or washer
for evidence of damage or wear.
Note
If the regulator has restricted capacity
trim, the percentage of full capacity
will be stamped on the outside of the
disk retainer. If this is done, the change
should be noted on the nameplate to
avoid confusion.
7. If either the sleeve or diaphragm must be
replaced, remove the screws (key 13) and
diaphragm plate (key 4). Remove the split ring
(key 7) and slide the lower diaphragm plate (key 5)
off the sleeve. This also exposes the O-ring (key 9)
in the lower diaphragm plate for inspection.
13
Type 310A
CAUTION
CAUTION
Assembly
Before assembly, be sure all parts are clean. During
assembly, lubricate all O-rings and both diaphragm
beads with a high quality lubricant. Be certain the
Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) backup rings (key 26)
are properly installed in the O-ring grooves in the base
body (key 2) and the case body (key 1).
1. Inspect the O-rings (key 9) and PTFE backup rings
(key 26) in the base body (key 2). If damaged,
replace with new parts.
2. Inspect the O-ring (key 9), backup rings (key 26)
and wiper ring (key 19) in the case body (key 1).
Replace with new parts if wear or damage is
noted. The wiper ring will not be present in units
designed for high temperatures.
3. Inspect the O-ring (key 9) in the lower diaphragm
plate (key 5). If damaged, install a new O-ring.
4. Place the split ring (key 7) on the sleeve (key 3)
and insert the sleeve in the lower diaphragm plate.
If the diaphragm in the following step
is installed with the wrong side against
the lower diaphragm plate, the beads
become distorted and the main valve will
not shut off properly.
5. Lubricate both diaphragm beads to facilitate
assembly and sealing of the diaphragm (key 6).
Place the inner bead of the diaphragm on the
lower diaphragm plate with the side marked
SPRING SIDE against the lower diaphragm plate.
Add the upper diaphragm plate (key 4) and install
the screws (key 13), tighten them down evenly.
Be sure the inner bead of the diaphragm does not
partially slip out from between the plates.
6. Fold the diaphragm down around the lower
diaphragm plate.
7. Fit the disk (key 27) into the disk holder (key 28).
Install the disk retainer (key 12) on top of the disk,
being sure the leading edge of the disk is properly
positioned around the outside of the retainer and is
not pinched under the retainer. Place the O-ring or
washer (key 11) on the sub-assembly and install in
the base body (key 2). Secure with the cap screw
(key 10).
8. On units with travel indicator, fit one edge of the
flanged head of the travel indicator rod (key 15)
into the groove in the diaphragm plate (key 4)
and slide the entire assembly into the base body
(key 2), being sure the travel indicator rod is
properly oriented so it enters and extends through
the hole in the base body and is visible through
the travel indicator cover (key 20). Check to make
sure indicator rod is still engaged in the diaphragm
plate groove.
9. Lubricate the body gasket (key 29) and the
gasket surface of the base body (key 2), place
the body gasket (key 29) on the base body.
Then fit the diaphragm bead over the machined
nose of the base body.
10. Place the spring (key 8) in the lower diaphragm
plate. On units with travel indicator, orient the case
body so that the pilot mounting bracket (key 45) is
in line with the travel indicator.
11. Fasten the two body halves together with the cap
screws (key 14) and tighten hand tight. Lubricating
the threads will make proper tightening easier.
Overtightening the cap screws in step
12 can damage the diaphragm. Do not
exceed the torque value listed in Table 4
when tightening the cap screws.
12. Alternately tighten the cap screws on opposite
sides of the unit to evenly compress the gasket.
Follow this sequence several times until the cap
screws will not turn at the maximum torque given
in Table 4. If this procedure is properly followed,
the gap between the two body halves will be
uniform all the way around.
13. Connect the external supply line to the pilot.
