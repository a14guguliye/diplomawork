for the 627 Series regulators. These regulators are usually
shipped separate for line installation, although sometimes
they are shipped installed on other equipment. Refer to the
Instruction Manual of the other equipment for installation and
operating instructions.
Description
The 627 Series direct-operated pressure reducing regulators
(Figure 1) are for high and low pressure systems. These
regulators can be used with natural gas, air or a variety of
other gases. Performance characteristics vary according
to construction.
▲ WARNING
Personal injury, property damage, equipment
damage or leakage due to escaping gas or
bursting of pressure-containing parts may
result if this regulator is overpressured or
is installed where service conditions could
exceed the limits given in the Specifications
section, Tables 1, 2, 3 and 4 or where
conditions exceed any ratings of the adjacent
piping or piping connections.
To avoid such injury or damage, provide
pressure-relieving or pressure-limiting
devices (as required by the appropriate code,
regulation or standard) to prevent service
conditions from exceeding those limits.
The Types 627R, 627LR or 627MR regulator
with internal relief will provide downstream
overpressure protection within the limits
given in the Specifications section, Tables 1,
2, 3 and 4. If these limits are exceeded,
additional downstream overpressure
protection must be provided by the user.
Additionally, physical damage to the regulator
could cause personal injury or property
damage due to escaping gas. To avoid such
injury or damage, install the regulator in a
safe location.

Principle of Operation
Refer to Figure 2. When downstream demand decreases,
the pressure under the diaphragm increases. This pressure
overcomes the regulator setting (which is set by a spring).
Through the action of the pusher post assembly, lever
and valve stem the valve disk moves closer to the orifice
and reduces gas flow. If demand downstream increases,
pressure under the diaphragm decreases. Spring force
pushes the pusher post assembly downward and the valve
disk moves away from the orifice.
Product Description
Types 627 and 627H Direct-Operated Pressure Reducing
Regulators—The Types 627 and 627H regulators provide
economical pressure reducing control for a variety of
residential, commercial and industrial applications. The
regulator pitot tube located in a high velocity stream provides
dynamic boost that compensates for outlet pressure drop.
Type 627 Long Body—The Type 627 Long Body regulator
can be used as a drop-in replacement for existing Type 630
installations without the need to modify piping.
Internal Relief for Type 627R, 627LR or 627MR
Regulator—The Type 627R internal relief performance
values were obtained by removing the disk assembly
from the regulator. For the Type 627R, 627LR or 627MR
regulator, the internal relief across the diaphragm provides
overpressure protection in many applications. As outlet
pressures build up above the start-to-discharge point, the
diaphragm moves off the relief valve seat allowing the
excess pressure to bleed out through the screened vent.
For extra protection, should failure conditions exist which
would prevent normal operation of the regulator (for
example, disk broken off or disk erosion), the pusher
post contacts the lever retainer causing the relief valve
assembly to open. Since the diaphragm continues to rise
as downstream pressure builds, it opens the relief valve;
thereby, opening the valve. This internal relief may be
adequate for the application.
Downstream Control Line for Type 627M, 627HM, 627MR,
627MOSX or 627HMOSX Regulator—A Type 627M,
627HM, 627MR, 627MOSX or 627HMOSX regulator has a
blocking throat stem seal with O-rings and a 1/4 NPT control
line connection in the diaphragm case. A regulator with a
downstream control line is used for monitoring applications
or other applications where other equipment is installed
between the regulator and the pressure control point. The
stem seal separates the body outlet pressure from the
diaphragm case.
Type 627OSX— The Type 627OSX regulator with integral
slam-shut device can provide either overpressure (OPSO)
or overpressure (OPSO) and underpressure (UPSO)
protection by completely shutting off the flow of gas to the
downstream system.
Installation
Regulator operation within ratings does not preclude
the possibility of damage from debris in the lines or from
external sources. A regulator should be inspected for
damage periodically and after any overpressure condition.
Key numbers referenced in this section are shown in
Figures 7 through 13. Ensure that the operating temperature
capabilities listed in Specifications section are not exceeded.
Note
If the regulator is shipped mounted on
another unit, install that unit according to the
appropriate Instruction Manual.
Perform steps 1 through 6 for all types of regulators:
1. Only personnel qualified through training and
experience should install, operate or maintain
this regulator.
2. For a regulator that is shipped separately, make
sure that there is no damage to or foreign material in
the regulator.
3. Ensure that all tubing and piping have been blown free
of foreign debris.
4. The regulator may be installed in any position as long as
the flow through the body is in the direction indicated by
the arrow cast on the body.

Type 627OSX must be installed in a horizontal position
and the mechanism box must be above or below the
body. It is recommended to install vents upstream and
downstream of the regulator between the shutoff valves.
Pipe supports should be used for flanged Type 627OSX
units due to weight.
See Type OS2 Instruction Manual (D102778X012) for
additional information.
5. If continuous operation is required during inspection
or maintenance, install a three-valve bypass around
the regulator.
▲ WARNING
A regulator may vent some gas to the
atmosphere. In hazardous or flammable gas
service, vented gas may accumulate and
cause personal injury, death or property
damage due to fire or explosion. Vent a
regulator in hazardous gas service to a
remote, safe location away from air intakes
or any hazardous area. The vent line or
stack opening must be protected against
condensation or clogging.
6. Position the body (key 1) and/or diaphragm spring case
(key 29) so it will not collect moisture or debris into the
screened vent. If the regulator requires repositioning,
refer to the Body Area Maintenance Procedures and/or
the Diaphragm and Spring Case Area Maintenance
Procedures in the Maintenance section to reposition the
screened vent for the application.
Perform steps 7 through 9 for Types 627M, 627HM,
627MR, 627MOSX and 627HMOSX regulators only:
7. A Type 627M, 627HM, 627MR, 627MOSX or
627HMOSX regulator requires a downstream control
line. Install the control line before putting the regulator
into operation.
8. Ensure that the downstream control line piping is at
least 3/8 in. / 9.5 mm or larger outside diameter tubing
and connected to a straight section of outlet piping 10
diameters downstream of the regulator.
9. A hand valve should be installed in the control line. This
hand valve can be used to throttle down and dampen
outlet pulsations in control pressure which may cause
instability or cycling of the regulator.
Remote Vent Line Installation
All 627 Series regulators have a vent assembly installed in the
3/4 NPT spring case vent opening. The vent assembly can be
removed to install a remote vent line if necessary. Remote vent
lines must have the largest practical diameter. It should be as
short as possible with minimum number of bends or elbows.
Protect the remote vent opening against entrance of rain,
snow or any other foreign material that may plug the vent
or vent line and prevent proper operation of the regulator.
Periodically check the vent opening to be sure it is not
plugged with foreign debris.

Type 627M or 627HM Regulator
De-Icer System Application
For the Type 627M or 627HM regulator de-icer system,
refer to the application shown in Figure 3. With a large
pressure drop across the working regulator, ice can form
within this regulator. The formation of ice decreases the
size of the orifice, so the regulator is unable to supply
enough flow to satisfy the downstream demand. When the
downstream pressure falls below the outlet pressure setting
of the Type 627M or 627HM regulator, the disk assembly
of the Type 627M or 627HM regulator moves off its orifice,
permitting alcohol to flow into the main gas line. The alcohol
carried to the main regulator by the flowstream prevents
additional ice from forming on the orifice. When normal
flow resumes and as pressure in the downstream system is
restored, the Type 627M or 627HM regulator shuts off.
Overpressure Protection
The 627 Series regulators have outlet pressure ratings
that are lower than their inlet pressure ratings. A pressure-
relieving or pressure-limiting device must be provided by the
user for the Types 627, 627H, 627M and 627HM regulators
if the inlet pressure can exceed the outlet pressure rating,
since these regulators do not have internal relief.
Types 627R and 627LR regulators provide internal relief
which limits the total outlet pressure buildup over setpoint.
Use Tables 3 and 4 to determine the total outlet pressure.
This internal relief may be adequate for the application, if
not, provide additional pressure relief or a pressure-limiting
device downstream.
Types 627OSX utilizes integral slam-shut device to provide
overpressure and underpressure protection by completely
shutting off the flow of gas to the downstream system.
Pressure is registered on one side of the diaphragm, piston
or bellows and is opposed by the setpoint control spring of
the manometric sensing device. The Type OS2 slam-shut
valve tripping pressure is determined by the setting of the
control spring.
Overpressure–When the downstream pressure increases
above the setpoint, the pressure on top of the diaphragm
overcomes the spring setting and moves the manometric
device stem.
Underpressure–When the downstream pressure decreases
below the setpoint, the control spring pressure below the
diaphragm overcomes the downstream pressure and pushes
the diaphragm which moves the manometric device stem.
See Type OS2 Instruction Manual (D102778X012) for
additional information.
Startup and Adjustment
Startup
▲ WARNING
To avoid personal injury or property damage
due to explosion or damage to regulator or
downstream components during startup,
release downstream pressure to prevent an
overpressure condition on the diaphragm of
the regulator.
In order to avoid an overpressure condition
and possible equipment damage, pressure
gauges should always be used to monitor
pressures during startup.
1. Slowly open the upstream shut-off valve.
2. Slowly open the downstream shut-off valve.
3. Check all connections for leaks.
4. Make final control spring adjustments according to the
adjustment procedures.

Adjustment
The range of allowable pressure settings is marked on
the nameplate. If a pressure setting beyond this range
is necessary, substitute the appropriate regulator control
spring. Change the nameplate to indicate the new
pressure range.
Before increasing the setting, refer to Table 1, 2, 3 or 4.
Review the pressure limits for the control spring range being
used and be certain that the new pressure setting will not
result in an overpressure condition.
Note
Always use a pressure gauge to monitor
pressure when making adjustments.
Refer to Figures 7 through 13 for key number locations.
1. Remove the adjusting screw cap (key 36).
2. Loosen the locknut (key 34).
3. Increase the outlet pressure setting by turning the
adjusting screw (key 35) clockwise. Decrease the
outlet pressure setting by turning the adjusting
screw counterclockwise.
4. When the desired pressure is obtained, hold the
adjusting screw (key 35) in place and tighten the locknut
(key 34).
Refer to Type OS2 Instruction Manual (D102778X012) for
instructions on adjusting the slam-shut.
Shutdown
▲ WARNING
To avoid personal injury or property damage
due to explosion or damage to regulator or
downstream components during shutdown,
release downstream pressure to prevent an
overpressure condition on the diaphragm of
the regulator.
1. Close the nearest upstream shut-off valve.
2. Close the nearest downstream shut-off valve.
3. Open the vent valve between the regulator and the
downstream shut-off valve nearest to it.
4. For a Type 627, 627H, 627R or 627LR regulator, the
regulator will open to release pressure between the
upstream shut-off valve and the regulator.
5. A Type 627M, 627HM or 627MR regulator requires
venting the control line and downstream pressure
from the regulator before maintenance. The pressure
between these shut-off valves is released through
the open regulator because the disk assembly
remains open in response to the decrease in control
line pressure.
6. Type 627OSX with underpressure protection may
trip and trap gas upstream of the regulator. It is
recommended to also open an upstream vent to allow
gas to escape.

- Shaded areas indicate maximum inlet pressures allowed during system malfunction only. Table 1 gives the maximum inlet pressure for normal regulator operation.
1. The internal relief performance values are obtained by removing the disk assembly.
2. For inlet pressures in excess of 1000 psig / 69.0 bar, refer to the maximum body and disk pressure ratings in the Specifications section.
3. For pressure settings under 10 psig / 0.69 bar, inlet pressure should be limited to approximately 100 psig / 6.9 bar so the setpoint adjustment can be obtained.

Maintenance
Unless otherwise specified, the following maintenance
procedures apply to all types of regulators. For a summary of
maximum torque values required for all types of regulators,
refer to Table 7.
Due to normal wear, damage from external sources or
debris in the air or gas line, regulator parts such as the
disk assembly orifice and diaphragm must be inspected
periodically and replaced as necessary to ensure correct
performance. The frequency of inspection and replacement
depends upon the severity of conditions and the
requirements of state and federal laws. Normal wear of the
orifice and disk assembly is accelerated with high pressure
drops and with large amounts of impurities in the flowstream.
Instructions are given below for replacing the disk assembly
orifice, diaphragm and O-rings. These procedures may
also be used for disassembly required for inspection and
replacement of other parts.
Note
Special tool required for Type 627OSX
Orifice Maintenance. 14 mm Hex with a 4 in. /
102 mm extension required to reach orifice.
Refer to Type OS2 Instruction Manual (D102778X012) for
instructions on maintaining the slam-shut.
Problem Indication for Types 627R, 627LR
and 627MR Regulators
▲ WARNING
Isolate the regulator from all pressure
to avoid personal injury and equipment
damage due to explosion or sudden
release of process pressure. Cautiously
release pressure from the regulator before
attempting disassembly.

The vent assembly is equipped with a relief indicator (key 49,
Figure 4). The cap for the relief indicator snaps over the vent
assembly opening. If the relief valve opens wide, exhaust
gas pops the cap off the screen vent assembly opening
indicating a problem with the regulator. If the cap pops off,
refer to the shutdown and to the Body Area Maintenance
Procedures to inspect the disk assembly and orifice.
If the disk assembly and orifice are not damaged, refer to the
Diaphragm and Spring Case Area Maintenance Procedures
in this section.
The disk assembly and orifice can be inspected,
removed and replaced without removing the regulator
body from the line connections. Refer to the Body Area
Maintenance Procedures.
Body Area Maintenance Procedures
These procedures are for gaining access to the disk
assembly orifice, diaphragm casing O-ring and stem
assembly. All pressure must be released from the diaphragm
casing before performing these steps.
While using the following procedures, refer to
Figures 7 through 13 for key number locations.
Replacing the Disk Assembly or Orifice
1. To inspect and replace the disk assembly (key 9) or
orifice (key 2), remove the cap screws (key 3, Figure 5)
and separate the diaphragm casing (key 5) from the
body (key 1).
2. Inspect and, if necessary, remove the orifice (key 2). If
removed, coat the threads of the replacement orifice
with lubricant and torque to 25 ft-lbs / 34 N•m.
3. Inspect the disk assembly (key 9) and, if necessary,
remove the hair pin clip (key 13) that holds the disk
assembly (key 9) in place. If replacing the disk assembly
is the only maintenance required, skip to step 16.
Replacing the Stem Assembly
If it is necessary to perform maintenance on the stem
assembly, continue with steps 4 through 8 and 15 through 19
for Types 627, 627H, 627R and 627LR regulators or steps 9
through 19 for Types 627M, 627HM and 627MR regulators.
